The comparison is conducted in terms of the essential parameters of any measurement system: accuracy, robustness, validity, functionality, time and costs. Empirical evidence shows that for the natural and formal sciences, the bibliometric methodology is by far preferable to peer-review. Setting up national databases of publications by individual authors, derived from Web of Science or Scopus databases, would allow much better, cheaper and more frequent national research assessments.},

The development of culture-independent sequencing techniques has provided unprecedented access to genomic data from a large number of so far inaccessible archaeal lineages. This is revolutionizing our view of the diversity and metabolic potential of the Archaea in a wide variety of environments, an important step toward understanding their ecological role. The archaeal tree is being rapidly filled up with new branches constituting phyla, classes and orders, generating novel challenges for high-rank systematics, and providing key information for dissecting the origin of this domain, the evolutionary trajectories that have shaped its current diversity, and its relationships with Bacteria and Eukarya.

The empirical evidence for the period 1994\textendash 2010 is based on 41 panels which together consist of 99 countries. The large dataset allows us to disaggregate countries into fundamental characteristics based on income levels (high-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and low-income), legal origins (English common-law, French civil-law, German civil-law and Scandinavian civil-law) and regional proximity (South Asia, Europe and Central Asia; East Asia and the Pacific; Middle East and North Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa). Three main issues are investigated: the presence or not of catch-up processes, the speed of the catch-up processes and the time needed for a complete elimination of country differences in scientific and technical publications. The findings based on absolute and conditional catch-up patterns broadly show that advanced countries will continue to dominate in scientific knowledge contribution.

  abstract = {DNA replication is arguably the most fundamental biological process. On account of their shared evolutionary ancestry, the replication machinery found in archaea is similar to that found in eukaryotes. DNA replication is initiated at origins and is highly conserved in eukaryotes, but our limited understanding of archaea has uncovered a wide diversity of replication initiation mechanisms. Archaeal origins are sequence-based, as in bacteria, but are bound by initiator proteins that share homology with the eukaryotic origin recognition complex subunit Orc1 and helicase loader Cdc6). Unlike bacteria, archaea may have multiple origins per chromosome and multiple Orc1/Cdc6 initiator proteins. There is no consensus on how these archaeal origins are recognised- some are bound by a single Orc1/Cdc6 protein while others require a multi- Orc1/Cdc6 complex. Many archaeal genomes consist of multiple parts-the main chromosome plus several megaplasmids-and in polyploid species these parts are present in multiple copies. This poses a challenge to the regulation of DNA replication. However, one archaeal species (Haloferax volcanii) can survive without replication origins; instead, it uses homologous recombination as an alternative mechanism of initiation. This diversity in DNA replication initiation is all the more remarkable for having been discovered in only three groups of archaea where in vivo studies are possible.},

The experiments were performed by the agency for validating the adoption in the Italian research assessment exercises of a dual system of evaluation, where some outputs were evaluated by bibliometrics and others by peer review. The two experiments were based on stratified random samples of journal articles. Each article was scored by bibliometrics and by peer review. The degree of concordance between the two evaluations is then computed. The correct setting of the experiments is defined by developing the design-based estimation of the Cohen's kappa coefficient and some testing procedures for assessing the homogeneity of missing proportions between strata. The results of both experiments show that for each research areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics the degree of agreement between bibliometrics and peer review is-at most-weak at an individual article level. Thus, the outcome of the experiments does not validate the use of the dual system of evaluation in the Italian research assessments. More in general, the very weak concordance indicates that metrics should not replace peer review at the level of individual article. Hence, the use of the dual system in a research assessment might worsen the quality of information compared to the adoption of peer review only or bibliometrics only.},

In most disciplines, there are well-established standards for performing and documenting research to facilitate reproducibility.

In published computational work, often there is no record of the workflow process that produced the published computational results, and in some cases, even the code is missing or has been changed significantly since the study was completed. In other cases, the computation is subject to numerical error and variability that makes it difficult to reconstruct the results on a different platform or by a different team of researchers. That tide may be changing, though, in the wake of some recent workshops and papers that recognize the need for explicit and widely implemented standards, and also an opportunity to do computational research work more effectively.

Viruses are presented as organisms which pass in their ontogenetic cycle through two distinctive phenotypic phases: (1) the vegetative phase and (2) the phase of viral particle or nucleic acid. In the vegetative phase, considered herein to be the ontogenetically mature phase of viruses, their component molecules are dispersed within the host cell. In this phase the virus shows the major physiological properties of other organisms: metabolism, growth, and reproduction. Therefore, life is an effective presence. It is shown also, that in this phase so called ``DNA viruses'' have both nucleic acids: RNA as well as DNA. The virions are considered to be ``spores'' or reproductive forms of the virus, possessing life only as a potential property.},

Peer review is the oldest form of monitoring the scientific process and research outcomes and is sometimes considered as the gold standard for evaluating quality. However, it also has its drawbacks; therefore, new forms of peer review are being explored. Bibliometrics, comparative statistics based on publication and citation counts, was introduced as a more objective evaluation method, which is applicable on meso and macro levels of research producing units but is not without problems either. Citation counts as a proxy of quality; the impact factor and the h-index are some of the most controversial subjects of research evaluation today. The newest addition to the evaluation toolbox are altmetrics, impact measures based mainly on social media activity. Altmetrics have pros and cons as well. None of the measuring devices is perfect, and rather than replacing they complement each other. By drawing on indicators from all three aspects of research evaluation, negative and adverse effects are limited.},

  abstract = {Reproducible research---by its many names---has come to be regarded as a key concern across disciplines and stakeholder groups. Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},

Though there was intense discussion about review articles in scientometrics in the 1970s and 1980s, we find less studies devoted to this genre within the last 20~years. Yet, recent discussions in other fields, such as linguistics, sociology or medicine imply that review articles are part of important debates about problems of research in academia, such as research quality or transparency. Against that background, the purpose of this paper is to review recent developments for the study of review articles in scientometrics and beyond, to discuss theoretical, conceptual and empirical accounts of how review articles can be defined, and to identify major methodological and conceptual challenges for studying review articles. Based on reviewing work and inputs received from of a workshop conducted at a Conference of the International Society of Informetrics in September 2019, we propose a research agenda for the study of review articles. We have identified six realms of study in this area: (1) the study of methodological caveats resulting from the usage of scholarly databases, (2) the study of field specific patterns of reception and usage of review articles, (3) the study of argumentative and textual structures of review articles, (4) the exploration of organizations and infrastructures for review articles, (5) the study of epistemic roles of review articles, and (6) the analysis of authorship patterns in review articles.},

I3 can also be used as a field-normalized indicator. Field-normalization is common practice in bibliometrics, especially when institutions and countries are compared. Publication and citation practices are so different among fields that citation impact is normalized for cross-field comparisons. In this study, we test the ability of the indicator to discriminate between quality levels of papers as defined by Faculty members at F1000Prime. F1000Prime is a post-publication peer review system for assessing papers in the biomedical area. Thus, we test the convergent validity of I3 (in this study, we test I3/N\textemdash the size-independent variant of I3 where I3 is divided by the number of papers) using assessments by peers as baseline and compare its validity with several other (field-normalized) indicators: the mean-normalized citation score, relative-citation ratio, citation score normalized by cited references, characteristic scores and scales, source-normalized citation score, citation percentile, and proportion of papers which belong to the x\% most frequently cited papers (PPtop x\%). The results show that the PPtop 1\% indicator discriminates best among different quality levels. I3 performs similar as (slightly better than) most of the other field-normalized indicators. Thus, the results point out that the indicator could be a valuable alternative to other indicators in bibliometrics.},

  abstract = {A characteristic feature of the domain archaea are the lipids forming the hydrophobic core of their cell membrane. These unique lipids are composed of iso-prenoid side-chains stereospecifically ether linked to sn-glycerol-1-phosphate. Recently, considerable progress has been made in characterizing the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of archaeal lipids. However, little is known about their evolution. To better understand how this unique biosynthetic apparatus came to be, large-scale database surveys and phylogenetic analyses were performed. All characterized enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of isoprenoid side-chains and the glycerol phosphate backbone along with their assembly in ether lipids were included in these analyses. The sequence data available in public databases was complemented by an in-depth sampling of isoprenoid lipid biosynthesis genes from multiple genera of the archaeal order Halobacteriales, allowing us to look at the evolution of these enzymes on a smaller phylogenetic scale. This investigation of the isoprenoid biosynthesis apparatus of archaea on small and large phylogenetic scales reveals that it evolved through a combination of evolutionary processes, including the co-option of ancestral enzymes, modification of enzymatic specificity, orthologous and non-orthologous gene displacement, integration of components from eukaryotes and bacteria and lateral gene transfer within and between archaeal orders.},

  abstract = {The journal impact factor (JIF) is the average of the number of citations of the papers published in a journal, calculated according to a specific formula; it is extensively used for the evaluation of research and researchers. The method assumes that all papers in a journal have the same scientific merit, which is measured by the JIF of the publishing journal. This implies that the number of citations measures scientific merits but the JIF does not evaluate each individual paper by its own number of citations. Therefore, in the comparative evaluation of two papers, the use of the JIF implies a risk of failure, which occurs when a paper in the journal with the lower JIF is compared to another with fewer citations in the journal with the higher JIF. To quantify this risk of failure, this study calculates the failure probabilities, taking advantage of the lognormal distribution of citations. In two journals whose JIFs are ten-fold different, the failure probability is low. However, in most cases when two papers are compared, the JIFs of the journals are not so different. Then, the failure probability can be close to 0.5, which is equivalent to evaluating by coin flipping.},

However, the Internet has radically changed the speed, flow, and sharing of medical information. Furthermore, the explosion of social media, along with development of popular professional and scientific websites and blogs, has led to the need for alternative metrics, known as altmetrics, to quantify the wider impact of research. We explore the evolution of current research impact metrics and examine the evolving role of altmetrics in measuring the wider impact of research. We suggest that altmetrics used in research evaluation should be part of an informed peer-review process such as traditional metrics. Moreover, results based on altmetrics must not lead to direct decision making about research, but instead, should be used to assist experts in making decisions. Finally, traditional and alternative metrics should complement, not replace, each other in the peer-review process.},

  abstract = {The eukaryotic ssDNA-binding protein, Replication protein A (RPA), was first discovered almost three decades ago. Since then, much progress has been made to elucidate the critical roles for RPA in DNA metabolic pathways that help promote genomic stability. The canonical RPA heterotrimer (RPA1-3) is an essential coordinator of DNA metabolism that interacts with ssDNA and numerous protein partners to coordinate its roles in DNA replication, repair, recombination and telomere maintenance. An alternative form of RPA, termed aRPA, is formed by a complex of RPA4 with RPA1 and RPA3. aRPA is expressed differentially in cells compared to canonical RPA and has been shown to inhibit canonical RPA function while allowing for regular maintenance of cell viability. Interestingly, while aRPA is defective in DNA replication and cell cycle progression, it was shown to play a supporting role in nucleotide excision repair and recombination. The binding domains of canonical RPA interact with a growing number of partners involved in numerous genome maintenance processes. The protein interactions of the RPA-ssDNA complex are not only governed by competition between the binding proteins but also by post-translation modifications such as phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of RPA2 is an important post-translational modification of the RPA complex, and is essential for directing context-specific functions of the RPA complex in the DNA damage response. Due to the importance of RPA in cellular metabolism, it was identified as an appealing target for chemotherapeutic drug development that could be used in future cancer treatment regimens.},

Once a preprint is published in a peer-reviewed venue, the preprint server updates its web page: a prominent hyperlink leading to the newly published work is added. Linking preprints to publications is of utmost importance as it provides readers with the latest version of a now certified work. Yet leading preprint servers fail to identify all existing preprint\textendash publication links. This limitation calls for a more thorough approach to this critical information retrieval task: overlooking published evidence translates into partial and even inaccurate systematic reviews on health-related issues, for instance. We designed an algorithm leveraging the Crossref public and free source of bibliographic metadata to comb the literature for preprint\textendash publication links. We tested it on a reference preprint set identified and curated for a living systematic review on interventions for preventing and treating COVID-19 performed by international collaboration: the COVID-NMA initiative (covid-nma.com). The reference set comprised 343 preprints, 121 of which appeared as a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. While the preprint servers identified 39.7\% of the preprint\textendash publication links, our linker identified 90.9\% of the expected links with no clues taken from the preprint servers. The accuracy of the proposed linker is 91.5\% on this reference set, with 90.9\% sensitivity and 91.9\% specificity. This is a 16.26\% increase in accuracy compared to that of preprint servers. We release this software as supplementary material to foster its integration into preprint servers' workflows and enhance a daily preprint\textendash publication chase that is useful to all readers, including systematic reviewers. This preprint\textendash publication linker currently provides day-to-day updates to the biomedical experts of the COVID-NMA initiative.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The peer review system has been traditionally challenged due to its many limitations especially for allocating funding. Bibliometric indicators may well present themselves as a complement. OBJECTIVE: We analyze the relationship between peers' ratings and bibliometric indicators for Spanish researchers in the 2007 National R\&D Plan for 23 research fields. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analyze peers' ratings for 2333 applications. We also gathered principal investigators' research output and impact and studied the differences between accepted and rejected applications. We used the Web of Science database and focused on the 2002-2006 period. First, we analyzed the distribution of granted and rejected proposals considering a given set of bibliometric indicators to test if there are significant differences. Then, we applied a multiple logistic regression analysis to determine if bibliometric indicators can explain by themselves the concession of grant proposals. RESULTS: 63.4\% of the applications were funded. Bibliometric indicators for accepted proposals showed a better previous performance than for those rejected; however the correlation between peer review and bibliometric indicators is very heterogeneous among most areas. The logistic regression analysis showed that the main bibliometric indicators that explain the granting of research proposals in most cases are the output (number of published articles) and the number of papers published in journals that belong to the first quartile ranking of the Journal Citations Report. DISCUSSION: Bibliometric indicators predict the concession of grant proposals at least as well as peer ratings. Social Sciences and Education are the only areas where no relation was found, although this may be due to the limitations of the Web of Science's coverage. These findings encourage the use of bibliometric indicators as a complement to peer review in most of the analyzed areas.},

Scientific knowledge is not an exception to the data boom. The phenomenon of data growth in science pushes forth as the number of scientific papers published doubles every 9\textendash 15 years, and the need for methods and tools to understand what is reported in scientific literature becomes evident.  As the number of academicians and innovators swells, so do the number of publications of all types, yielding outlets of documents and depots of authors and institutions that need to be found in Bibliometric databases. These databases are dug into and treated to hand over metrics of research performance by means of Scientometrics that analyze the toil of individuals, institutions, journals, countries, and even regions of the world.  The objective of this book is to assist students, professors, university managers, government, industry, and stakeholders in general, understand which are the main Bibliometric databases, what are the key research indicators, and who are the main players in university rankings and the methodologies and approaches that they employ in producing ranking tables.  The book is divided into two sections. The first looks at Scientometric databases, including Scopus and Google Scholar as well as institutional repositories. The second section examines the application of Scientometrics to world-class universities and the role that Scientometrics can play in competition among them. It looks at university rankings and the methodologies used to create these rankings. Individual chapters examine specific rankings that include:   QS World University Scimago Institutions Webometrics U-Multirank U.S. News \& World Report The book concludes with a discussion of university performance in the age of research analytics.},

Research related to this disease is pivotal for assessing pathogenic characteristics and formulating therapeutic strategies. The aim of this paper is to explore the activity and trends of COVID-19 research since its outbreak in December 2019. Methods: We explored the PubMed database and the World Health Organization (WHO) database for publications pertaining to COVID-19 since December 2019 up until March 18, 2020. Only relevant observational and interventional studies were included in our study. Data on COVID-19 incidence were extracted from the WHO situation reports. Research output was assessed with respect to gross domestic product (GDP) and population of each country. Results: Only 564 publications met our inclusion criteria. These articles came from 39 different countries, constituting 24\% of all affected countries. China produced the greatest number of publications with 377 publications (67\%). With respect to continental research activity, Asian countries had the highest research activity with 434 original publications (77\%). In terms of publications per million persons (PPMPs), Singapore had the highest number of publications with 1.069 PPMPs. In terms of publications per billion-dollar GDP, Mauritius ranked first with 0.075.

  abstract = {Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is an aerobic thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon which grows optimally at 80\textdegree C and pH 2 in terrestrial solfataric springs. Here, we describe the genome sequence of strain DSM639, which has been used for many seminal studies on archaeal and crenarchaeal biology. The circular genome carries 2,225,959 bp (37\% G+C) with 2,292 predicted protein-encoding genes. Many of the smaller genes were identified for the first time on the basis of comparison of three Sulfolobus genome sequences. Of the protein-coding genes, 305 are exclusive to S. acidocaldarius and 866 are specific to the Sulfolobus genus. Moreover, 82 genes for untranslated RNAs were identified and annotated. Owing to the probable absence of active autonomous and nonautonomous mobile elements, the genome stability and organization of S. acidocaldarius differ radically from those of Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus tokodaii. The S. acidocaldarius genome contains an integrated, and probably encaptured, pARN-type conjugative plasmid which may facilitate intercellular chromosomal gene exchange in S. acidocaldarius. Moreover, it contains genes for a characteristic restriction modification system, a UV damage excision repair system, thermopsin, and an aromatic ring dioxygenase, all of which are absent from genomes of other Sulfolobus species. However, it lacks genes for some of their sugar transporters, consistent with it growing on a more limited range of carbon sources. These results, together with the many newly identified protein-coding genes for Sulfolobus, are incorporated into a public Sulfolobus database which can be accessed at http://dac.molbio.ku.dk/dbs/Sulfolobus .},

These enzymes perform topological transformations by providing a transient DNA break, formed by a covalent adduct with the enzyme, through which strand passage can occur. The active site tyrosine is responsible for initiating two transesterifications to cleave and then religate the DNA backbone. The cleavage reaction intermediate is exploited by cytotoxic agents, which have important applications as antibiotics and anticancer drugs. The reactions mediated by these enzymes can also be regulated by their binding partners; one example is a DNA helicase capable of modulating the directionality of strand passage, enabling important functions like reannealing denatured DNA and resolving recombination intermediates.

  abstract = {The preprints landscape is evolving rapidly, and the full impact of sharing articles in pre-review form remains to be seen. After publishing our initial report `The evolving preprint landscape' in 2018 and a slide deck 'Practices, drivers and impediments in the use of preprints' in spring 2019, we are now able to share our final report 'Accelerating scholarly communication - The transformative role of preprints'. Preprints (tentatively defined as versions of research papers typically prior to peer review and publication in a journal) have become more widespread in a number of disciplines over the last few years, partly to counter the slow pace of the traditional publishing process and partly to allow authors to reach a broader audience. Knowledge Exchange, in collaboration with Research Consulting, investigated this phenomenon in order to explore the current place of preprints in the scholarly communication process. In this context, we interviewed 38 stakeholders, including researchers, research performing organisations, research funding organisations and preprint service providers, and reviewed over 60 literature sources. Our key results include the benefits and challenges for researchers in using preprints as well as the establishment of trust without peer review including the role of twitter. Moreover, we reflect on the responsibilities for preprint posting in the future and the role of scholarly communities and commercial publishers. In addition to our latest report you can find our detailed analysis in the preprint 'Preprints and Scholarly Communication: Adoption, Practices, Drivers and Barriers' by Research Consulting on F1000. {$<$}em{$>$}* Please note two corrections to Appendix A of the report 'Accelerating scholarly communication - The transformative role of preprints'.

  abstract = {The BRAIN Initiative aims to break new ground in the scale and speed of data collection in neuroscience, requiring tools to handle data in the magnitude of yottabytes (1024). The scale, investment and organization of it are being compared to the Human Genome Project (HGP), which has exemplified `big science' for biology. In line with the trend towards Big Data in genomic research, the promise of the BRAIN Initiative, as well as the European Human Brain Project, rests on the possibility to amass vast quantities of data to model the complex interactions between the brain and behaviour and inform the diagnosis and prevention of neurological disorders and psychiatric disease. Advocates of this `data driven' paradigm in neuroscience argue that harnessing the large quantities of data generated across laboratories worldwide has numerous methodological, ethical and economic advantages, but it requires the neuroscience community to adopt a culture of data sharing and open access to benefit from them. In this article, we examine the rationale for data sharing among advocates and briefly exemplify these in terms of new `open neuroscience' projects. Then, drawing on the frequently invoked model of data sharing in genomics, we go on to demonstrate the complexities of data sharing, shedding light on the sociological and ethical challenges within the realms of institutions, researchers and participants, namely dilemmas around public/private interests in data, (lack of) motivation to share in the academic community, and potential loss of participant anonymity. Our paper serves to highlight some foreseeable tensions around data sharing relevant to the emergent `open neuroscience' movement.},

  abstract = {The extension of virology beyond its traditional medical, veterinary, or agricultural applications, now called environmental virology, has shown that viruses are both the most numerous and diverse biological entities on Earth. In particular, virus isolations from unicellular eukaryotic hosts (heterotrophic and photosynthetic protozoans) revealed numerous viral types previously unexpected in terms of virion structure, gene content, or mode of replication. Complemented by large-scale metagenomic analyses, these discoveries have rekindled interest in the enigma of the origin of viruses, for which a description encompassing all their diversity remains not available. Several laboratories have repeatedly tackled the deep reconstruction of the evolutionary history of viruses, using various methods of molecular phylogeny applied to the few shared ``core'' genes detected in certain virus groups (e.g., the Nucleocytoviricota). Beyond the practical difficulties of establishing reliable homology relationships from extremely divergent sequences, I present here conceptual arguments highlighting several fundamental limitations plaguing the reconstruction of the deep evolutionary history of viruses, and even more the identification of their unique or multiple origin(s). These arguments also underline the risk of establishing premature high level viral taxonomic classifications. Those limitations are direct consequences of the random mechanisms governing the reductive/retrogressive evolution of all obligate intracellular parasites.},

Faced with the complexity of analysis pipelines, the large number of computational tools, and the enormous amount of data to manage, there is compelling evidence that many if not most scientific discoveries will not stand the test of time: increasing the reproducibility of computed results is of paramount importance. The objective we set out in this paper is to place scientific workflows in the context of reproducibility. To do so, we define several kinds of reproducibility that can be reached when scientific workflows are used to perform experiments. We characterize and define the criteria that need to be catered for by reproducibility-friendly scientific workflow systems, and use such criteria to place several representative and widely used workflow systems and companion tools within such a framework. We also discuss the remaining challenges posed by reproducible scientific workflows in the life sciences. Our study was guided by three use cases from the life science domain involving in silico experiments.},

While these models accurately describe the stochastic processes of site-specific substitutions, single-base substitutions represent only a fraction of all the events that shape genomes. Specifically, in microbes, events in which entire genes are gained (e.g. via horizontal gene transfer) and lost play a pivotal evolutionary role. In this research, we present a novel likelihood-based evolutionary model for gene gains and losses, and use it to analyse genome-wide patterns of the presence and absence of gene families. The model assumes a Markovian stochastic process, where gains and losses are represented by the transition between presence and absence, respectively, given an underlying phylogenetic tree. To account for differences in the rates of gain and loss of different gene families, we assume among-gene family rate variability, thus allowing for more accurate description of the data. Using the Bayesian approach, we estimated an evolutionary rate for each gene family. Simulation studies demonstrated that our methodology accurately infers these rates. Our methodology was applied to analyse a large corpus of data, consisting of 4873 gene families spanning 63 species and revealed novel insights regarding the evolutionary nature of genome-wide gain and loss dynamics.},

As a consequence of this, there has been a strong uptake of data availability statements in recent literature. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what proportion of these statements actually contain well-formed links to data, for example via a URL or permanent identifier, and if there is an added value in providing such links. We consider 531, 889 journal articles published by PLOS and BMC, develop an automatic system for labelling their data availability statements according to four categories based on their content and the type of data availability they display, and finally analyze the citation advantage of different statement categories via regression. We find that, following mandated publisher policies, data availability statements become very common. In 2018 93.7\% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2\% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository\textemdash rather than being available on request or included as supporting information files\textemdash are a fraction of the total. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8\% of PLOS publications and 12.2\% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. We also find an association between articles that include statements that link to data in a repository and up to 25.36\% ({$\pm$} 1.07\%) higher citation impact on average, using a citation prediction model. We discuss the potential implications of these results for authors (researchers) and journal publishers who make the effort of sharing their data in repositories.

These actions provide a powerful means to effect changes in DNA supercoiling levels, and allow some topoisomerases to both unknot and decatenate chromosomes. Since their initial discovery over three decades ago, researchers have amassed a rich store of information on the cellular roles and regulation of topoisomerases, and have delineated general models for their chemical and physical mechanisms. Topoisomerases are now known to be necessary for the survival of cellular organisms and many viruses and are rich clinical targets for anticancer and antimicrobial treatments. In recent years, crystal structures have been obtained for each of the four types of topoisomerases in a number of distinct conformational and substrate-bound states. In addition, sophisticated biophysical methods have been utilized to study details of topoisomerase reaction dynamics and enzymology. A synthesis of these approaches has provided researchers with new physical insights into how topoisomerases employ chemistry and allostery to direct the large-scale molecular motions needed to pass DNA strands through each other.},

In this article we review the literature examining the relationship between OA status and citation counts of scholarly articles. Early studies showed a correlation between the free online availability or OA status of articles and higher citation counts, and implied causality without due consideration of potential confounding factors. More recent investigations have dissected the nature of the relationship between article OA status and citations. Three non-exclusive postulates have been proposed to account for the observed citation differences between OA and non-OA articles: an open access postulate, a selection bias postulate, and an early view postulate. The most rigorous study to date (in condensed matter physics) showed that, after controlling for the early view postulate, the remaining difference in citation counts between OA and non-OA articles is explained by the selection bias postulate. No evidence was found to support the OA postulate per se; i.e. article OA status alone has little or no effect on citations. Further studies using a similarly rigorous approach are required to determine the generality of this finding.},

  abstract = {Background: The ability of external investigators to reproduce published scientific findings is critical for the evaluation and validation of biomedical research by the wider community. However, a substantial proportion of health research using electronic health records (EHR), data collected and generated during clinical care, is potentially not reproducible mainly due to the fact that the implementation details of most data preprocessing, cleaning, phenotyping and analysis approaches are not systematically made available or shared. With the complexity, volume and variety of electronic health record data sources made available for research steadily increasing, it is critical to ensure that scientific findings from EHR data are reproducible and replicable by researchers. Reporting guidelines, such as RECORD and STROBE, have set a solid foundation by recommending a series of items for researchers to include in their research outputs. Researchers however often lack the technical tools and methodological approaches to actuate such recommendations in an efficient and sustainable manner. Results: In this paper, we review and propose a series of methods and tools utilized in adjunct scientific disciplines that can be used to enhance the reproducibility of research using electronic health records and enable researchers to report analytical approaches in a transparent manner. Specifically, we discuss the adoption of scientific software engineering principles and best-practices such as test-driven development, source code revision control systems, literate programming and the standardization and re-use of common data management and analytical approaches. Conclusion: The adoption of such approaches will enable scientists to systematically document and share EHR analytical workflows and increase the reproducibility of biomedical research using such complex data sources.},

Government policies from 3 countries (UK, Australia and Spain) are reviewed. Each country outlines a commitment to the democratisation of science for one set of policies whilst ignoring this commitment when developing parallel research evaluation policies. We propose a change in dialogue from whether bibliometrics should be used to how they should be used in future evaluations. Future research policies should take advantage of bibliometrics to foster greater democratisation of research to create more socially-reflexive evaluation systems.},

  abstract = {Neoliberal ideas \textendash{} whether the new public management, principal-agent theory, or performance management \textendash{} have provided rationale for sweeping reforms in the governance and operation of higher education. Despite this, little attention has been devoted to how well neoliberal theory illuminates the policy process by which neoliberal policy is enacted and implemented. This paper expands our understanding of the origins, implementation, and impacts of neoliberal policies by examining the case of performance-based funding (PBF) for higher education in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and elsewhere. With regard to policy origins, neoliberal theory anticipates the key role that top government officials play in the development of PBF but fails to anticipate the important roles of business and higher education institutions in the formation of neoliberal policies. Neoliberal theory notes the important role of monetary incentives as policy instruments and the obstacles posed by gaming on the part of agents, but the implementation of PBF also involves other policy instruments and faces additional obstacles to implementation. Policy outcomes fitting the neoliberal focus on organizational effectiveness and efficiency are only weakly produced by PBF, but PBF is associated with a host of unintended impacts that neoliberal theory ignores.},

There are three types of bibliometric indicators: quantity indicators, which measure the productivity of a particular researcher; quality indicators, which measure the quality (or ``performance'') of a researcher's output; and structural indicators, which measure connections between publications, authors, and areas of research. Bibliometric indicators are especially important for researchers and organizations, as these measurements are often used in funding decisions, appointments, and promotions of researchers. As more and more scientific discoveries occur and published research results are read and then quoted by other researchers, bibliometric indicators are becoming increasingly important. This article provides an overview of the currently used bibliometric indicators and summarizes the critical elements and characteristics one should be aware of when evaluating the quantity and quality of scientific output.\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2010},

Our aim within this work was to show that there are different perceptions of viruses and many concepts to explain their emergence: the virus-first concept (also called co-evolution), the escape and the reduction theories. Moreover, a relatively new concept of polyphyletic virus origin called ``three RNA cells, three DNA viruses'' proposed by Forterre is described herein. In this paper, not only is each thesis supported by a body of evidence but also counter-argued in the light of various findings to give more insightful considerations to the readers. As the origin of viruses and that of living cells are most probably interdependent, we decided to reveal ideas concerning nature of cellular last universal common ancestor (LUCA). Furthermore, we discuss monophyletic ancestry of cellular domains and their relationships at the molecular level of membrane lipids and replication strategies of these three types of cells. In this review, we also present the emergence of DNA viruses requiring an evolutionary transition from RNA to DNA and recently discovered giant DNA viruses possibly involved in eukaryogenesis. In the course of evolution viruses emerged many times. They have always played a key role through horizontal gene transfer in evolutionary events and in formation of the tree of life or netlike routes of evolution providing a great deal of genetic diversity. In our opinion, future findings are crucial to better understand past relations between viruses and cells and the origin of both.},

In this article we discuss these principles, along with the practical steps in performing meta-analysis. Meta-analysis should be viewed as an observational study of the evidence. The steps involved are similar to any other research undertaking: formulation of the problem to be addressed, collection and analysis of the data, and reporting of the results. Researchers should write in advance a detailed research protocol that clearly states the objectives, the hypotheses to be tested, the subgroups of interest, and the proposed methods and criteria for identifying and selecting relevant studies and extracting and analysing information. As with criteria for including and excluding patients in clinical studies, eligibility criteria have to be defined for the data to be included. Criteria relate to the quality of trials and to the combinability of treatments, patients, outcomes, and lengths of follow up. Quality and design features of a study can influence the results.4 5 Ideally, researchers should consider including only controlled trials with proper randomisation of patients that report on all initially included patients according to the intention to treat principle and with an objective, preferably blinded, outcome assessment.6 Assessing the quality of a study \ldots},

  abstract = {In their search to understand the evolution of biological complexity, John Maynard Smith and E\"ors Szathm\'ary put forward the notion of major evolutionary transitions as those in which elementary units get together to generate something new, larger and more complex. The origins of chromosomes, eukaryotic cells, multicellular organisms, colonies and, more recently, language and technological societies are examples that clearly illustrate this notion. However, a transition may be considered as anecdotal or as major depending on the specific level of biological organization under study. In this contribution, I will argue that transitions may also be occurring at a much smaller scale of biological organization: the viral world. Not only that, but also that we can observe in real time how these major transitions take place during experimental evolution. I will review the outcome of recent evolution experiments with viruses that illustrate four major evolutionary transitions: (i) the origin of a new virus that infects an otherwise inaccessible host and completely changes the way it interacts with the host regulatory and metabolic networks, (ii) the incorporation and loss of genes, (iii) the origin of segmented genomes from a non-segmented one, and (iv) the evolution of cooperative behaviour and cheating between different viruses or strains during co-infection of the same host.

  abstract = {Open access (OA) to the research literature has the potential to accelerate recognition and dissemination of research findings, but its actual effects are controversial. This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at ``quasi-baseline'' (December 2004, 0\textendash 6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4\textendash 10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10\textendash 16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors' lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2\% of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8\%) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0\%) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8\%) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk = 1.3 [95\% Confidence Interval: 1.1\textendash 1.6]; p = 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 [13.6\%], OA: 11 [5.2\%]; relative risk = 2.6 [1.4\textendash 4.7]; p {$<$} 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 [SD = 2.5] versus 1.2 [SD = 2.0]; Z = 3.123; p = 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 [SD = 10.4] versus 4.5 [SD = 4.9]; Z = 4.058; p {$<$} 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio = 2.1 [1.5\textendash 2.9]) in the first 4\textendash 10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5\textendash 5.5) 10\textendash 16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating dissemination and uptake of research findings.},

The central role of cellular organization is observed by the fact that "cellular life" is often used as a synonym for life itself. Thus, most characteristics used to define cells overlap with the ones used to define life. Notwithstanding, new scenarios about the origin of life are bringing alternative views to describe how cells may have evolved from the open biological systems named progenotes. Here, using a logical and conceptual analysis, we re-evaluate the characteristics used to infer a single origin for cells. We argue that some evidences used to support cell monophyly, such as the presence of elements from both the translation mechanism and the universality of the genetic code, actually indicate a unique origin for all "biological systems", a term used to define not only cells, but also virus and progenotes. Besides, we present evidence that at least two biochemical pathways as important as (i) DNA replication and (ii) lipid biosynthesis may not homologous between Bacteria and Archaea. The identities observed between the proteins involved in those pathways along representatives of these two ancestral Domains are too low to indicate common genic ancestry. Altogether these facts can be seen as an indication that cellular organization has possibly evolved two or more times and that LUCA (the Last Universal Common Ancestor) might not have existed as a cellular entity. Thus, we aim to consider the possibility that different strategies acquired by biological systems to exist, such as viral, bacterial and archaeal were originated independently from the evolution of different progenote populations.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the experience of being an academic in the UK in the contemporary climate of neoliberal capitalism and `metric power' (Beers 2016). Drawing on existing literature and our own practice, the first portion of the paper explores the relationship between neoliberalism, metrics and knowledge. We then examine how neoliberal mantras and instruments impact the university's structures and processes, and reflect on consequences for the academic self. We take as a starting point the context of increasing workloads and the pressure on academics to excel in multiple roles, from `world-leading' researchers to `excellent' teachers and `service providers' to professional administrators performing recruitment and (self)marketing tasks. Neoliberal academia, we suggest, promotes a meritocratic ideology of individual achievement that frames success and failure as purely personal `achievements', which encourages a competitive ethos and chronic self-criticism. This article insists that these problems need to be understood in the context of neoliberal policy-making and the corporatisation of knowledge, including funding cuts and grant imperatives, the low status of teaching, the cynical instrumentation of university league tables, and increased institutional reliance on precarious academic labour. The article goes on to focus on responses that resist, challenge or, in some cases, compound, the problems identified in part one. Responses by dissatisfied academics range in style and approach \textendash{} some decide against an academic career; others adopt a strategy of individual withdrawal within the system by trying to create and protect spaces of independence \textendash{} for example, by refusing to engage beyond officially required minimums. This article argues that opportunities for positive systemic change can be found in collective efforts to oppose the status quo and to create alternatives for how academic labour is organised. Therein, solidarity can act as an instrument of opposition to the individualisation of the neoliberal academic self.},

The conditions contributing to irreproducibility in other disciplines are also present in ecology. These include a large discrepancy between the proportion of ``positive'' or ``significant'' results and the average statistical power of empirical research, incomplete reporting of sampling stopping rules and results, journal policies that discourage replication studies, and a prevailing publish-or-perish research culture that encourages questionable research practices. We argue that these conditions constitute sufficient reason to systematically evaluate the reproducibility of the evidence base in ecology and evolution. In some cases, the direct replication of ecological research is difficult because of strong temporal and spatial dependencies, so here, we propose metaresearch projects that will provide proxy measures of reproducibility.},

  abstract = {SummaryThe transition from the RNA to the DNA world was a major event in the history of life. The invention of DNA required the appearance of enzymatic activities for both synthesis of DNA precursors, retro-transcription of RNA templates and replication of single- and double-stranded DNA molecules. Recent data from comparative genomics, structural biology and traditional biochemistry have revealed that several of these enzymatic activities have been invented independently more than once, indicating that the transition from RNA to DNA genomes was more complex than previously thought. The distribution of the different protein families corresponding to these activities in the three domains of life (Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria) is puzzling. In many cases, Archaea and Eukarya contain the same version of these proteins, whereas Bacteria contain another version. However, in other cases, such as thymidylate synthases or type II DNA topoisomerases, the phylogenetic distributions of these proteins donot follow this simple pattern. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these observations, including independent invention of DNA and DNA replication proteins, ancient gene transfer and gene loss, and/or nonorthologous replacement. We review all of them here, with more emphasis on recent proposals suggesting that viruses have played a major role in the origin and evolution of the DNA replication proteins and possibly of DNA itself.},

The three current hypotheses for virus origin, e.g. the virus first, the escape and the reduction hypotheses are revisited in this new framework. Theoretical considerations suggest that RNA viruses may have originated in the nucleoprotein world by escape or reduction from RNA-cells, whereas DNA viruses (at least some of them) might have evolved directly from RNA viruses. The antiquity of viruses can explain why most viral proteins have no cellular homologues or only distantly related ones. Viral proteins have replaced the ancestral bacterial RNA/DNA polymerases and primase during mitochondrial evolution. It has been suggested that replacement of cellular proteins by viral ones also occurred in early evolution of the DNA replication apparatus and/or that some DNA replication proteins originated directly in the virosphere and were later on transferred to cellular organisms. According to these new hypotheses, viruses played a critical role in major evolutionary transitions, such as the invention of DNA and DNA replication mechanisms, the formation of the three domains of life, or else, the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus.},

As a consequence, one should have naively expected to find homologous topoisomerases in all cellular organisms, dating back to their last common ancestor. However, as observed for other enzymes working with DNA, this is not the case. Phylogenomics analyses indicate that different sets of topoisomerases were present in the most recent common ancestors of each of the three cellular domains of life (some of them being common to two or three domains), whereas other topoisomerases families or subfamilies were acquired in a particular domain, or even a particular lineage, by horizontal gene transfers. Interestingly, two groups of viruses encode topoisomerases that are only distantly related to their cellular counterparts. To explain these observations, we suggest that topoisomerases originated in an ancestral virosphere, and that various subfamilies were later on transferred independently to different ancient cellular lineages. We also proposed that topoisomerases have played a critical role in the origin of modern genomes and in the emergence of the three cellular domains.},

Focusing on the viral factory instead of the virion adds credit to this hypothesis, but also suggests alternative scenarios. Beside a role in the emergence of the nucleus, ancient NCLDV may have provided new genes and/or chromosomes to the proto-eukaryotic lineage. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that NCLDV informational proteins, related to those of Archaea and Eukarya, were either recruited by ancient NCLDV from proto-eukaryotes and/or transferred to proto-eukaryotes, in agreement with the antiquity of NCLDV and their possible role in eukaryogenesis.},

Such rankings do not effectively measure research quality, which should be the essence of any evaluation. These quantity rankings are not objective; two citation rankings, based on different samples, produce entirely different results. For that reason, an alternative ranking is developed as a quality indicator, based on membership on academic editorial boards of professional journals. It turns out that the ranking of individual scholars based on that measure is far from objective. Furthermore, the results differ markedly, depending on whether research quantity or quality is considered. Thus, career decisions based on rankings are dominated by chance and do not reflect research quality. We suggest that evaluations should rely on multiple criteria. Public management should return to approved methods such as engaging independent experts who in turn provide measurements of research quality for their research communities.

I have used a software package called HistCiteTM which generates chronological maps of subject (topical) collections resulting from searches of the ISI Web of Science1 or ISI citation indexes (SCI, SSCI, and/or AHCI) on CD-ROM. When a marked list is created on WoS, an export file is created which contains all cited references for each source document captured. These bibliographic collections, saved as ASCII files, are processed by HistCite in order to generate chronological and other tables as well as historiographs which highlight the most-cited works in and outside the collection. HistCite also includes a module for detecting and editing errors or variations in cited references as well as a vocabulary analyzer which generates both ranked word lists and word pairs used in the collection. Ideally the system will be used to help the searcher quickly identify the most significant work on a topic and trace its year-by-year historical development. In addition to the collections mentioned above, historiographs based on collections of papers that cite the Watson-Crick 1953 classic paper identifying the helical structure of DNA were created. Both year-by-year as well as month-by-month displays of papers from 1953 to 1958 were necessary to highlight the publication activity of those years.},

On the basis of this comparison, and focusing in particular on Britain, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of performance-based funding in comparison with other approaches to funding. Our analysis suggests that, while initial benefits may outweigh the costs, over time such a system seems to produce diminishing returns. This raises important questions about its continued use.},

  abstract = {Successful high-fidelity chromosomal DNA replication is fundamental to all forms of cellular life and requires the complex interplay of a variety of essential and nonessential protein factors in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. Much of what is known about the enzymes and mechanisms of chromosome replication has come from analysis of simple microbial model systems, such as yeast and archaea. Archaea possess a highly simplified eukaryotic-like replication apparatus, making them an excellent model for gaining novel insights into conserved aspects of protein function at the heart of the replisome. Amongst the thermophilic archaea, a number of species have proved useful for biochemical analysis of protein function, but few of these organisms are suited to genetic analysis. One archaeal organism that is genetically tractable is the mesophilic euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii, a halophile that grows aerobically in high salt medium at an optimum temperature of 40\textendash 45 \textdegree C and with a doubling time of 2\textendash 3 h. The Hfx. volcanii genome has been sequenced and a range of methods have been developed to allow reverse genetic analysis of protein function in vivo, including techniques for gene replacement and gene deletion, transcriptional regulation, point mutation and gene tagging. Here we briefly summarize current knowledge of the chromosomal DNA replication machinery in the haloarchaea before describing in detail the molecular methods available to probe protein structure and function within the Hfx. volcanii replication apparatus.},

Bibliometrics is one  of the few subfields concerned with measuring the output side of science. According to most ``histories'', bibliometrics owes  its systematic development mainly to D.J.D. Price and Eugene Garfield, as founders. The few works conducted before the 1950s  are usually relegated to prehistory. This paper documents how the systematic counting of publications originated with psychologists.  In the early 1900s, psychologists began collecting statistics on their discipline. Publications came to be counted in addresses,  reviews and histories of psychology for several decades. The aim was to contribute to the advancement of psychology. Far from  being a negligible output of a prehistoric type, both the volume and the systematicness of these efforts are witnesses to  what should be considered as pioneering work, and their authors considered as forerunners to bibliometrics.  {$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This paper studies the influence of both publication modalities on the average impact of the journal and its evolution over time. It tries to identify the separate effect of access on citation into two major parts: early view and selection effect, managing to provide some evidence of the positive effect of both. Scopus is used as the database and CiteScore as the measure of journal impact. The prevalence of both publication modalities is quantified. Differences in the average impact factor of group of journals, according to their publication modalities, are tested. The evolution over time of the citation influence, from 2011 to 2016, is also analysed. Finally, a linear regression to explain the correlation of these publication practices with the CiteScore in 2016, in a ceteris paribus context, is estimated. Our main findings show evidence of a positive correlation between average journal impact and advancing the publication of accepted articles, moreover this correlation increases over time. The open access modality, in a ceteris paribus context, also correlates positively with average journal impact.},

Most archaeal proteins participating in DNA replication are more similar in sequence to those found in eukarya than to analogous replication proteins in bacteria. However, archaea have only a subset of the eukaryal replication machinery, apparently needing fewer polypeptides and structurally simpler complexes. The archaeal replication apparatus also contains features not found in other organisms owing, in part, to the broad range of environmental conditions, some extreme, in which members of this domain thrive. In this review the current knowledge of the mechanisms governing DNA replication in archaea is summarized and the similarities and differences of those of bacteria and eukarya are highlighted.},

They shook the very definition of viruses and shed new light on the debate over their nature and putative role in the evolution of the cellular domains. Their origin(s) and evolution remain to be elucidated, however. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal the evolutionary relationships between the NCLDV families and their origin from a common ancestor, from which they diversified before the origin of modern eukaryotes. Our results also point to their likely role in the emergence of multiple DNA-dependent RNA polymerases in proto-eukaryotes., Giant and large eukaryotic double-stranded DNA viruses from the Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Virus (NCLDV) assemblage represent a remarkably diverse and potentially ancient component of the eukaryotic virome. However, their origin(s), evolution, and potential roles in the emergence of modern eukaryotes remain subjects of intense debate. Here we present robust phylogenetic trees of NCLDVs, based on the 8 most conserved proteins responsible for virion morphogenesis and informational processes. Our results uncover the evolutionary relationships between different NCLDV families and support the existence of 2 superclades of NCLDVs, each encompassing several families. We present evidence strongly suggesting that the NCLDV core genes, which are involved in both informational processes and virion formation, were acquired vertically from a common ancestor. Among them, the largest subunits of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase were transferred between 2 clades of NCLDVs and proto-eukaryotes, giving rise to 2 of the 3 eukaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Our results strongly suggest that these transfers and the diversification of NCLDVs predated the emergence of modern eukaryotes, emphasizing the major role of viruses in the evolution of cellular domains.},

Since 2001, Inserm has set up the on-line file management software for the evaluation of researchers and laboratories, called EVA (www.eva.inserm.fr). EVA includes all grant applications, assessment reports, grading evaluation forms and include an automated bibliometric indicator software that enables to calculate for each researcher of the teams, the number of publications, impact factor of journals, number of citations, citation index, number of Top 1\% publications \ldots{} The indicators take into account research fields, the year of publications, the author position within the participants., Bibliometrics is now considered as a tool for science policy providing indicators to measure productivity and scientific quality, thereby supplying a basis for evaluating and orienting R\&D. It is also a potential tool for evaluation. It is neutral, allows comparative (national \& international) assessment and may select papers in the forefront in all fields. For each team bibliometric indicators were calculated for all researchers with permanent positions or long term positions (3 to 5 years). The use of bibliometric indicators requires a great vigilance but according to our experience they without any doubt enrich the committee's debates. We present the analysis of the data of 600 research teams evaluated in 2007\textendash 2008.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this paper are to provide an introduction to meta-analysis and to discuss the rationale for this type of research and other general considerations. Methods used to produce a rigorous meta-analysis are highlighted and some aspects of presentation and interpretation of meta-analysis are discussed., Meta-analysis is a quantitative, formal, epidemiological study design used to systematically assess previous research studies to derive conclusions about that body of research. Outcomes from a meta-analysis may include a more precise estimate of the effect of treatment or risk factor for disease, or other outcomes, than any individual study contributing to the pooled analysis. The examination of variability or heterogeneity in study results is also a critical outcome. The benefits of meta-analysis include a consolidated and quantitative review of a large, and often complex, sometimes apparently conflicting, body of literature. The specification of the outcome and hypotheses that are tested is critical to the conduct of meta-analyses, as is a sensitive literature search. A failure to identify the majority of existing studies can lead to erroneous conclusions; however, there are methods of examining data to identify the potential for studies to be missing; for example, by the use of funnel plots. Rigorously conducted meta-analyses are useful tools in evidence-based medicine. The need to integrate findings from many studies ensures that meta-analytic research is desirable and the large body of research now generated makes the conduct of this research feasible.},

We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5\%-16\% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p {$<$} 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36\%-172\% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r {$>$} .90, N=12, p {$<$} .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p {$<$} .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100\% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA). Further research will analyze the effect's timing, causal components and relation to other variables.},

  abstract = {A researcher's number of publications has been a fundamental merit in the competition for academic positions since the late 18th century. Today, the simple counting of publications has been supplemented with a whole range of bibliometric indicators, which supposedly not only measures the volume of research but also its impact. In this study, we investigate how bibliometrics are used for evaluating the impact and quality of publications in two specific settings: biomedicine and economics. Our study exposes the various metrics used in external evaluations of candidates for academic positions at Swedish universities. Moreover, we show how different bibliometric indicators, both explicitly and implicitly, are employed to assess and rank candidates. Our findings contribute to a further understanding of bibliometric indicators as `judgment devices' that are employed in evaluating individuals and their published works within specific fields. We also show how `expertise' in using bibliometrics for evaluative purposes is negotiated at the interface between domain knowledge and skills in using indicators. In line with these results, we propose that the use of metrics we report is best described as a form of `citizen bibliometrics'\textemdash an underspecified term which we build upon in the article.},

An introduction to the main features of the software is first provided in Chapter 2. Chapters 3 and 4 subsequently provide detailed instructions on how to conduct effect Author and Journal Queries. Chapter 5 is devoted to the broader applications of the General Citation search that can be used to find particular papers, conduct advanced author and journal queries, compare institutional performance and conduct a literature review. Finally, Chapter 6 discusses how the Multi-query Center can be used to effectively store and manage queries for future use. Part 2: Day-to-day uses of Publish or Perish citation analysis In Part 2, I present the most common day-to-day uses of the Publish or Perish software. Chapter 7 provides tips and tricks for academics that need to make their case for tenure or promotion. I discuss the importance of reference groups as well as several ways to show your citation record to its best advantage. In Chapter 8, I discuss how to evaluate other academics. The examples in this chapter vary from a 5-minute preparation before meeting someone you don't know, to evaluating editorial board members or prospective PhD supervisors, from writing up tributes (or laudations) and eulogies to deciding on publication awards and preparing for a job interview. Chapter 9 turns the tables and looks at citation analysis for Deans and other academic administrators. It includes four topics: the need to accept Google Scholar as an alternative data source, the myths about self-citation, the inappropriateness of citation analysis at early career stages, and the differences in citation impact across disciplines.},

  abstract = {Researchers are used to being evaluated: publications, hiring, tenure and funding decisions are all based on the evaluation of research. Traditionally, this evaluation relied on judgement of peers but, in the light of limited resources and increased bureaucratization of science, peer review is getting more and more replaced or complemented with bibliometric methods. Central to the introduction of bibliometrics in research evaluation was the creation of the Science Citation Index (SCI) in the 1960s, a citation database initially developed for the retrieval of scientific information. Embedded in this database was the Impact Factor, first used as a tool for the selection of journals to cover in the SCI, which then became a synonym for journal quality and academic prestige. Over the last 10 years, this indicator became powerful enough to influence researchers' publication patterns in so far as it became one of the most important criteria to select a publication venue. Regardless of its many flaws as a journal metric and its inadequacy as a predictor of citations on the paper level, it became the go-to indicator of research quality and was used and misused by authors, editors, publishers and research policy makers alike. The h-index, introduced as an indicator of both output and impact combined in one simple number, has experienced a similar fate, mainly due to simplicity and availability. Despite their massive use, these measures are too simple to capture the complexity and multiple dimensions of research output and impact. This chapter provides an overview of bibliometric methods, from the development of citation indexing as a tool for information retrieval to its application in research evaluation, and discusses their misuse and effects on researchers' scholarly communication behavior.},

We have sequenced the structural gene encoding the DNA pol C catalytic subunit of the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus. This gene, designated the Taq DNA pol C gene, contains a 3660-bp open reading frame which specifies a polypeptide of molecular weight of 137,388 daltons. Comparative sequence analyses revealed that Taq DNA pol C is a class I family C DNA polymerase. The Taq DNA pol C is most closely related to the Deinococcus radiodurans DNA pol C. Although a phylogenetic tree based on the class I family C DNA pols is still in the provisional stage, some important conclusion can be drawn. First, the high-G+C and the low-G+C Gram-positive bacteria are not monophyletic. Second, the low-G+C Gram-positive bacteria contain multigenes of family C DNA pols (classes I and II). Third, the cyanobacterial family C DNA pol, classified as class III because it is encoded by a split gene, forms a group with the high-G+C Gram-positive bacteria.},

Today, a typical experiment can simultaneously measure hundreds to thousands of individual features (e.g. genes) in dozens of biological conditions, resulting in gigabytes of data that need to be processed and analyzed. Because of the multiple steps involved in the data generation and analysis and the lack of details provided, it can be difficult for independent researchers to try to reproduce a published study. With the recent outrage following the halt of a cancer clinical trial due to the lack of reproducibility of the published study, researchers are now facing heavy pressure to ensure that their results are reproducible. Despite the global demand, too many published studies remain non-reproducible mainly due to the lack of availability of experimental protocol, data and/or computer code. Scientific discovery is an iterative process, where a published study generates new knowledge and data, resulting in new follow-up studies or clinical trials based on these results. As such, it is important for the results of a study to be quickly confirmed or discarded to avoid wasting time and money on novel projects. The availability of high-quality, reproducible data will also lead to more powerful analyses (or meta-analyses) where multiple data sets are combined to generate new knowledge. In this article, we review some of the recent developments regarding biomedical reproducibility and comparability and discuss some of the areas where the overall field could be improved.},

We use academic publications in refereed journals (in all areas and specifically in engineering) as a proxy of scientific performance. As regards the impacts of scientific performance, we distinguish between high- and middle-income countries and, among the latter, between Asian and Latin America. The results show that academic publications are consistently and positively correlated with income per capita, for both middle and high-income countries. We also find non-linear effects in both groups. Those effects are lower for middle-income countries suggesting the presence of decreasing returns on academic performance. Finally, while Asian countries benefited from specialization in engineering research, no such effects were found for their Latin American peers.},

  abstract = {Abstract A system called QUALIS was implemented in Brazil in 2009, intended to rank graduate programs from different subject areas and promote selected national journals. Since this system uses a complicated suit of criteria (differing among subject areas) to group journals into discrete categories, it could potentially create incentives to publish in low-impact journals ranked highly by QUALIS. Here I assess the influence of the QUALIS journal ranking system on the global impact of Brazilian science. Brazil shows a steeper decrease in the number of citations per document since the implementation of this QUALIS system, compared to the top Latin American countries publishing more scientific articles. All subject areas showed some degree of bias, with social sciences being usually more biased than natural sciences. Lastly, the decrease in the number of citations over time proved steeper in a more biased subject area, suggesting a faster shift towards low-impact journals. Overall, the findings documented here suggest that the QUALIS system has undermined the global impact of Brazilian science, and reinforce a recent recommendation from an official committee evaluating graduate programs to eliminate QUALIS. A system based on impact metrics could avoid introducing distorted incentives, and thereby boost the global impact of Brazilian science.},

Biosynthesis of these lipids is poorly understood. Here we identify and characterize the archaeal membrane protein CDP-archaeol synthase (CarS) that catalyzes the transfer of the nucleotide to its specific archaeal lipid substrate, leading to the formation of a CDP-activated precursor (CDP-archaeol) to which polar head groups are attached. The discovery of CarS enabled reconstitution of the entire archaeal lipid biosynthesis pathway in~vitro, starting from simple isoprenoid building blocks and using a set of five purified enzymes. The cell free synthetic strategy for archaeal lipids we describe opens opportunity for studies of archaeal lipid biochemistry. Additionally, insights into archaeal lipid biosynthesis reported here allow addressing the evolutionary hypothesis of the lipid divide between Archaea and Bacteria.},

  abstract = {The use of bibliometric measures in the evaluation of research has increased considerably based on expertise from the growing research field of evaluative citation analysis (ECA). However, mounting criticism of such metrics suggests that the professionalization of bibliometric expertise remains contested. This paper investigates why impact metrics, such as the journal impact factor and the h-index, proliferate even though their legitimacy as a means of professional research assessment is questioned. Our analysis is informed by two relevant sociological theories: Andrew Abbott's theory of professions and Richard Whitley's theory of scientific work. These complementary concepts are connected in order to demonstrate that ECA has failed so far to provide scientific authority for professional research assessment. This argument is based on an empirical investigation of the extent of reputational control in the relevant research area. Using three measures of reputational control that are computed from longitudinal inter-organizational networks in ECA (1972\textendash 2016), we show that peripheral and isolated actors contribute the same number of novel bibliometric indicators as central actors. In addition, the share of newcomers to the academic sector has remained high. These findings demonstrate that recent methodological debates in ECA have not been accompanied by the formation of an intellectual field in the sociological sense of a reputational organization. Therefore, we conclude that a growing gap exists between an academic sector with little capacity for collective action and increasing demand for routine performance assessment by research organizations and funding agencies. This gap has been filled by database providers. By selecting and distributing research metrics, these commercial providers have gained a powerful role in defining de-facto standards of research excellence without being challenged by expert authority.},

  abstract = {This paper builds on previous research concerned with the classification and specialty mapping of research fields. Two methods are put to test in order to decide if significant differences as to mapping results of the research front of a science field occur when compared. The first method was based on document co-citation analysis where papers citing co-citation clusters were assumed to reflect the research front. The second method was bibliographic coupling where likewise citing papers were assumed to reflect the research front. The application of these methods resulted in two different types of aggregations of papers: (1) groups of papers citing clusters of co-cited works and (2) clusters of bibliographically coupled papers. The comparision of the two methods as to mapping results was pursued by matching word profiles of groups of papers citing a particular co-citation cluster with word profiles of clusters of bibliographically coupled papers. Findings suggested that the research front was portrayed in two considerably different ways by the methods applied. It was concluded that the results in this study would support a further comparative study of these methods on a more detailed and qualitative ground. The original data set encompassed 73,379 articles from the fifty most cited environmental science journals listed in Journal Citation Report, science edition downloaded from the Science Citation Index on CD-ROM.},

Exhaustive comparative genomic analysis of S. islandicus LAL14/1 and the nine other completely sequenced S. islandicus strains isolated from Iceland, Russia and USA revealed a highly syntenic common core genome of approximately 2 Mb and a long hyperplastic region containing most of the strain-specific genes. In LAL14/1, the latter region is enriched in insertion sequences, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), glycosyl transferase genes, toxin-antitoxin genes and MITE (miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements). The tRNA genes of LAL14/1 are preferential targets for the integration of mobile elements but clusters of atypical genes (CAG) are also integrated elsewhere in the genome. LAL14/1 carries five CRISPR loci with 10 per cent of spacers matching perfectly or imperfectly the genomes of archaeal viruses and plasmids found in the Icelandic hot springs. Strikingly, the CRISPR\_2 region of LAL14/1 carries an unusually long 1.9 kb spacer interspersed between two repeat regions and displays a high similarity to pING1-like conjugative plasmids. Finally, we have developed a genetic system for S. islandicus LAL14/1 and created {$\Delta$}pyrEF and {$\Delta$}CRISPR\_1 mutants using double cross-over and pop-in/pop-out approaches, respectively. Thus, LAL14/1 is a promising model to study virus-host interactions and the CRISPR/Cas defence mechanism in Archaea.},

  abstract = {Pyruvate kinases (PKs) synthesize ATP as the final step of glycolysis in the three domains of life. PKs from most bacteria and eukarya are allosteric enzymes that are activated by sugar phosphates; for example, the feed-forward regulator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, or AMP as a sensor of energy charge. Archaea utilize unusual glycolytic pathways, but the allosteric properties of PKs from these species are largely unknown. Here, we present an analysis of 24 PKs from most archaeal clades with respect to allosteric properties, together with phylogenetic analyses constructed using a novel mode of rooting protein trees. We find that PKs from many Thermoproteales, an order of crenarchaeota, are allosterically activated by 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG). We also identify five conserved amino acids that form the binding pocket for 3PG. 3PG is generated via an irreversible reaction in the modified glycolytic pathway of these archaea and therefore functions as a feed-forward regulator. We also show that PKs from hyperthermophilic Methanococcales, an order of euryarchaeota, are activated by AMP. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that 3PG-activated PKs form an evolutionary lineage that is distinct from that of sugar-phosphate activated PKs, and that sugar phosphate-activated PKs originated as AMP-regulated PKs in hyperthermophilic Methanococcales. Since the phospho group of sugar phosphates and 3PG overlap in the allosteric site, our data indicate that the allostery in PKs first started from a progenitor phosphate-binding site that evolved in two spatially distinct directions: one direction generated the canonical site that responds to sugar phosphates and the other gave rise to the 3PG site present in Thermoproteales. Overall, our data suggest an intimate connection between the allosteric properties and evolution of PKs.},

The hypothesis was that the three different peer review systems would have different correlations with the same set of scientometric indicators. In the last two decision-making systems (2005 and 2008) where conflict of interest was effectively avoided, we have a high percentage (65\%) of projects that would have been selected in the call irrespective of the method (peer review or bibliometrics solely). In contrast, in the 2003 call there is a significantly smaller percentage (49\%) of projects that would have been selected in the call irrespective of the method (peer review or bibliometrics solely). It was shown that while scientometric indicators can hardly replace the peer-review system as the ultimate decision-making and support system, they can reveal its weaknesses on one hand and on the other can verify peer-review scores and minimize conflict of interest if necessary.},

In this article, we pursue two goals, namely the collection of empirical data about researchers' personal estimations of the importance of the h-index for themselves as well as for their academic disciplines, and on the researchers' concrete knowledge on the h-index and the way of its calculation. We worked with an online survey (including a knowledge test on the calculation of the h-index), which was finished by 1081 German university professors. We distinguished between the results for all participants, and, additionally, the results by gender, generation, and field of knowledge. We found a clear binary division between the academic knowledge fields: For the sciences and medicine the h-index is important for the researchers themselves and for their disciplines, while for the humanities and social sciences, economics, and law the h-index is considerably less important. Two fifths of the professors do not know details on the h-index or wrongly deem to know what the h-index is and failed our test. The researchers' knowledge on the h-index is much smaller in the academic branches of the humanities and the social sciences. As the h-index is important for many researchers and as not all researchers are very knowledgeable about this author-specific indicator, it seems to be necessary to make researchers more aware of scholarly metrics literacy.},

PolB enzymes that require RNA (or DNA) primed templates for DNA synthesis are found in all domains of life and many DNA viruses.

Massive accumulation of new genomic and metagenomic data from diverse habitats as well as availability of new structural information prompted us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the PolB sequences, structures, domain organizations, taxonomic distribution and co-occurrence in genomes. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we identified a new, widespread group of bacterial PolBs that are more closely related to the catalytically active N-terminal half of the eukaryotic PolEpsilon (PolEpsilonN) than to Escherichia coli Pol II. In Archaea, we characterized six new groups of PolBs. Two of them show close relationships with eukaryotic PolBs, the first one with PolEpsilonN, and the second one with PolAlpha, PolDelta and PolZeta. In addition, structure comparisons suggested common origin of the catalytically inactive C-terminal half of PolEpsilon (PolEpsilonC) and PolAlpha. Finally, in certain archaeal PolBs we discovered C-terminal Zn-binding domains closely related to those of PolAlpha and PolEpsilonC. Collectively, the obtained results allowed us to propose a scenario for the evolution of eukaryotic PolBs.},

The h-index of 402 members listed in 10 distinct categories by the BAS was determined, cross-checked with the curriculum vitae of each of them listed at the Plataforma Lattes database (CVL) and compared with each other. Despite the large production, mostly in journals without impact factor, the h-indexes among the BAS members are comparatively low and show a large variation in all of the 10 categories, particularly in Biomedical and Physical sciences. The highest average of h-index values was found in Biomedical, Health and Chemical sciences; the lowest values were found in Human sciences where this index is meaningless.

  abstract = {Reproducibility has been shown to be limited in many scientific fields. This question is a fundamental tenet of scientific activity, but the related issues of reusability of scientific data are poorly documented. Here, we present a case study of our difficulties in reproducing a published bioinformatics method even though code and data were available. First, we tried to re-run the analysis with the code and data provided by the authors. Second, we reimplemented the whole method in a Python package to avoid dependency on a MATLAB license and ease the execution of the code on a high-performance computing cluster. Third, we assessed reusability of our reimplementation and the quality of our documentation, testing how easy it would be to start from our implementation to reproduce the results. In a second section, we propose solutions from this case study and other observations to improve reproducibility and research efficiency at the individual and collective levels.While finalizing our code, we created case-specific documentation and tutorials for the associated Python package StratiPy. Readers are invited to experiment with our reproducibility case study by generating the two confusion matrices (see more in section ``Robustness: from MATLAB to Python, language and organization"). Here, we propose two options: a step-by-step process to follow in a Jupyter/IPython notebook or a Docker container ready to be built and run.},

Isoprenoid chains are synthesized through the classical mevalonate pathway, as in eucarya, with minor modifications in some archaeal species. Most enzymes involved in the pathway have been identified enzymatically and/or genomically. Three of the relevant enzymes are found in enzyme families different from the known enzymes. The order of reactions in the phospholipid synthesis pathway (glycerophosphate backbone formation, linking of glycerophosphate with two radyl chains, activation by CDP, and attachment of common polar head groups) is analogous to that of bacteria.                 sn                 -Glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase is responsible for the formation of the                 sn-                 glycerol-1-phosphate backbone of phospholipids in all archaea. After the formation of two ether bonds, CDP-archaeol acts as a common precursor of various archaeal phospholipid syntheses. Various phospholipid-synthesizing enzymes from archaea and bacteria belong to the same large CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase family. In short, the first halves of the phospholipid synthesis pathways play a role in synthesis of the characteristic structures of archaeal and bacterial phospholipids, respectively. In the second halves of the pathways, the polar head group-attaching reactions and enzymes are homologous in both domains. These are regarded as revealing the hybrid nature of phospholipid biosynthesis. Precells proposed by W\"achtersh\"auser are differentiated into archaea and bacteria by spontaneous segregation of enantiomeric phospholipid membranes (with                 sn-                 glycerol-1-phosphate and                 sn-                 glycerol-3-phosphate backbones) and the fusion and fission of precells. Considering the nature of the phospholipid synthesis pathways, we here propose that common phospholipid polar head groups were present in precells before the differentiation into archaea and bacteria.},

Objectives The aim of the study was to analyse the historical perspective of research literature production regarding application of bibliometrics in medicine. Methods Publications related to application of bibliometrics in medicine from 1970 to 2018 were harvested from the Scopus bibliographic database. Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy was triangulated with the VOSViewer to identify historical roots and evolution of topics and clinical areas. Results The search resulted in 6557 publications. The literature production trend was positive. Historical roots analysis identified 33 historical roots and 16 clinical areas where bibliometrics was applied. Discussion The increase in productivity in application of bibliometrics in medicine might be attributed to increased use of quantitative metrics in research evaluation, publish or perish phenomenon and the increased use of evidence-based medicine. Conclusion The trend of the literature production was positive. Medicine was in the forefront of knowledge development in bibliometrics. reference publication year spectroscopy proved to be an accurate method which was able to identify most of the historical roots.},

  title = {Temporal Order of Evolution of {{DNA}} Replication Systems Inferred by Comparison of Cellular and Viral {{DNA}} Polymerases},
  author = {Koonin, Eugene V},
  year = {2006},
  pages = {18},
  abstract = {Background: The core enzymes of the DNA replication systems show striking diversity among cellular life forms and more so among viruses. In particular, and counter-intuitively, given the central role of DNA in all cells and the mechanistic uniformity of replication, the core enzymes of the replication systems of bacteria and archaea (as well as eukaryotes) are unrelated or extremely distantly related. Viruses and plasmids, in addition, possess at least two unique DNA replication systems, namely, the protein-primed and rolling circle modalities of replication. This unexpected diversity makes the origin and evolution of DNA replication systems a particularly challenging and intriguing problem in evolutionary biology. Results: I propose a specific succession for the emergence of different DNA replication systems, drawing argument from the differences in their representation among viruses and other selfish replicating elements. In a striking pattern, the DNA replication systems of viruses infecting bacteria and eukaryotes are dominated by the archaeal-type B-family DNA polymerase (PolB) whereas the bacterial replicative DNA polymerase (PolC) is present only in a handful of bacteriophage genomes. There is no apparent mechanistic impediment to the involvement of the bacterial-type replication machinery in viral DNA replication. Therefore, I hypothesize that the observed, markedly unequal distribution of the replicative DNA polymerases among the known cellular and viral replication systems has a historical explanation. I propose that, among the two types of DNA replication machineries that are found in extant life forms, the archaeal-type, PolB-based system evolved first and had already given rise to a variety of diverse viruses and other selfish elements before the advent of the bacterial, PolC-based machinery. Conceivably, at that stage of evolution, the niches for DNA-viral reproduction have been already filled with viruses replicating with the help of the archaeal system, and viruses with the bacterial system never took off. I further suggest that the two other systems of DNA replication, the rolling circle mechanism and the protein-primed mechanism, which are represented in diverse selfish elements, also evolved prior to the emergence of the bacterial replication system. This hypothesis is compatible with the distinct structural affinities of PolB, which has the palm-domain fold shared with reverse transcriptases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and PolC that has a distinct, unrelated nucleotidyltransferase fold. I propose that PolB is a descendant of polymerases that were involved in the replication of genetic elements in the RNA-protein world, prior to the emergence of DNA replication. By contrast, PolC might have evolved from an ancient non-templated polymerase, e.g., polyA polymerase. The proposed temporal succession of the evolving DNA replication systems does not depend on the specific scenario adopted for the evolution of cells and viruses, i.e., whether viruses are derived from cells or virus-like elements are thought to originate from a primordial gene pool. However, arguments are presented in favor of the latter scenario as the most parsimonious explanation of the evolution of DNA replication systems. Conclusion: Comparative analysis of the diversity of genomic strategies and organizations of viruses and cellular life forms has the potential to open windows into the deep past of life's evolution, especially, with the regard to the origin of genome replication systems. When complemented with information on the evolution of the relevant protein folds, this comparative approach can yield credible scenarios for very early steps of evolution that otherwise appear to be out of reach.},

  title = {The Ancient {{Virus World}} and Evolution of Cells},
  author = {Koonin, Eugene V and Senkevich, Tatiana G and Dolja, Valerian V},
  year = {2006},
  pages = {27},
  abstract = {Background: Recent advances in genomics of viruses and cellular life forms have greatly stimulated interest in the origins and evolution of viruses and, for the first time, offer an opportunity for a data-driven exploration of the deepest roots of viruses. Here we briefly review the current views of virus evolution and propose a new, coherent scenario that appears to be best compatible with comparative-genomic data and is naturally linked to models of cellular evolution that, from independent considerations, seem to be the most parsimonious among the existing ones. Results: Several genes coding for key proteins involved in viral replication and morphogenesis as well as the major capsid protein of icosahedral virions are shared by many groups of RNA and DNA viruses but are missing in cellular life forms. On the basis of this key observation and the data on extensive genetic exchange between diverse viruses, we propose the concept of the ancient virus world. The virus world is construed as a distinct contingent of viral genes that continuously retained its identity throughout the entire history of life. Under this concept, the principal lineages of viruses and related selfish agents emerged from the primordial pool of primitive genetic elements, the ancestors of both cellular and viral genes. Thus, notwithstanding the numerous gene exchanges and acquisitions attributed to later stages of evolution, most, if not all, modern viruses and other selfish agents are inferred to descend from elements that belonged to the primordial genetic pool. In this pool, RNA viruses would evolve first, followed by retroid elements, and DNA viruses. The Virus World concept is predicated on a model of early evolution whereby emergence of substantial genetic diversity antedates the advent of full-fledged cells, allowing for extensive gene mixing at this early stage of evolution. We outline a scenario of the origin of the main classes of viruses in conjunction with a specific model of precellular evolution under which the primordial gene pool dwelled in a network of inorganic compartments. Somewhat paradoxically, under this scenario, we surmise that selfish genetic elements ancestral to viruses evolved prior to typical cells, to become intracellular parasites once bacteria and archaea arrived at the scene. Selection against excessively aggressive parasites that would kill off the host ensembles of genetic elements would lead to early evolution of temperate viruslike agents and primitive defense mechanisms, possibly, based on the RNA interference principle. The emergence of the eukaryotic cell is construed as the second melting pot of virus evolution from which the major groups of eukaryotic viruses originated as a result of extensive recombination of genes from various bacteriophages, archaeal viruses, plasmids, and the evolving eukaryotic genomes. Again, this vision is predicated on a specific model of the emergence of eukaryotic cell under which archaeo-bacterial symbiosis was the starting point of eukaryogenesis, a scenario that appears to be best compatible with the data. Conclusion: The existence of several genes that are central to virus replication and structure, are shared by a broad variety of viruses but are missing from cellular genomes (virus hallmark genes) suggests the model of an ancient virus world, a flow of virusspecific genes that went uninterrupted from the precellular stage of life's evolution to this day. This concept is tightly linked to two key conjectures on evolution of cells: existence of a complex, precellular, compartmentalized but extensively mixing and recombining pool of genes, and origin of the eukaryotic cell by archaeo-bacterial fusion. The virus world concept and these models of major transitions in the evolution of cells provide complementary pieces of an emerging coherent picture of life's history.},

This stage of evolution might makes up the Last Universal Cellular Ancestor (LUCA) that more appropriately could be denoted Last Universal Cellular Ancestral State (LUCAS). Such a scenario recapitulates the ideas of J. B. S. Haldane sketched in his classic 1928 essay. However, unlike in Haldane's day, considerable support for this scenario exits today: lack of homology between core DNA replication system components in archaea and bacteria, distinct membrane chemistries and enzymes of lipid biosynthesis in archaea and bacteria, spread of several viral hallmark genes among diverse groups of viruses, and the extant archaeal and bacterial chromosomes appear to be shaped by accretion of diverse, smaller replicons. Under the viral model of precellular evolution, the key components of cells originated as components of virus-like entities. The two surviving types of cellular life forms, archaea and bacteria, might have emerged from the LUCAS independently, along with, probably, numerous forms now extinct.},

All these viruses have double-stranded DNA genomes that range in size from about 100 kilobases (kb) to more than 2.5 megabases. The viruses with genomes larger than 500kb are informally considered ``giant,'' and the largest giant viruses surpass numerous bacteria and archaea in both particle and genome size. The discovery of giant viruses has been highly unexpected and has changed the perception of viral size and complexity, and even, arguably, the entire concept of a virus. Given that giant viruses encode multiple proteins that are universal among cellular life forms and are components of the translation system, the quintessential cellular molecular machinery, attempts have been made to incorporate these viruses in the evolutionary tree of cellular life. Moreover, evolutionary scenarios of the origin of giant viruses from a fourth, supposedly extinct domain of cellular life have been proposed. However, despite all the differences in the genome size and gene repertoire, the NCLDV can be confidently defined as monophyletic group, on the strength of the presence of about 40 genes that can be traced back to their last common ancestor. Using several most strongly conserved genes from this ancestral set, a well-resolved phylogenetic tree of the NCLDV was built and employed as the scaffold to reconstruct the history of gene gain and loss throughout the course of the evolution of this group of viruses. This reconstruction reveals extremely dynamic evolution that involved extensive gene gain and loss in many groups of viruses and indicates that giant viruses emerged independently in several clades of the NCLDV. Thus, these giants of the virus world evolved repeatedly from smaller and simpler viruses, rather than from a fourth domain of cellular life, and captured numerous genes, including those for translation system components, from eukaryotes, along with some bacterial genes. Even deeper evolutionary reconstructions reveal apparent links between the NCLDV and smaller viruses of eukaryotes, such as adenoviruses, and ultimately, derive all these viruses from tailless bacteriophages.},

  abstract = {The halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii has been proposed to degrade glucose via the semiphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff (spED) pathway. Following our previous studies on key enzymes of this pathway, we now focus on the characterization of enzymes involved in 3-phosphoglycerate conversion to pyruvate, in anaplerosis, and in acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) formation from pyruvate. These enzymes include phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The essential function of these enzymes were shown by transcript analyses and growth experiments with respective deletion mutants. Furthermore, we show that H. volcanii\textemdash during aerobic growth on glucose\textemdash excreted significant amounts of acetate, which was consumed in the stationary phase (acetate switch). The enzyme catalyzing the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate as part of the acetate overflow mechanism, an ADPforming acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACD), was characterized. The functional involvement of ACD in acetate formation and of AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs) in activation of excreted acetate was proven by using respective deletion mutants. Together, the data provide a comprehensive analysis of enzymes of the spED pathway and of anaplerosis and report the first genetic evidence of the functional involvement of enzymes of the acetate switch in archaea.},

Our knowledge of eukaryotic and bacteria cell biology has been built on a foundation of studies in model organisms, using the complementary approaches of genetics and biochemistry. Archaea have led to some exciting discoveries in the field of biochemistry, but archaeal genetics has been slow to get off the ground, not least because these organisms inhabit some of the more inhospitable places on earth and are therefore believed to be difficult to culture. In fact, many species can be cultivated with relative ease and there has been tremendous progress in the development of genetic tools for both major archaeal phyla, the Euryarchaeota and the Crenarchaeota. There are several model organisms available for methanogens, halophiles, and thermophiles; in the latter group, there are genetic systems for Sulfolobales and Thermococcales. In this review, we present the advantages and disadvantages of working with each archaeal group, give an overview of their different genetic systems, and direct the neophyte archaeologist to the most appropriate model organism.},

  abstract = {DNA replication is central to all extant cellular organisms. There are substantial functional similarities between the bacterial and the archaeal/eukaryotic replication machineries, including but not limited to defined origins, replication bidirectionality, RNA primers and leading and lagging strand synthesis. However, several core components of the bacterial replication machinery are unrelated or only distantly related to the functionally equivalent components of the archaeal/eukaryotic replication apparatus. This is in sharp contrast to the principal proteins involved in transcription and translation, which are highly conserved in all divisions of life. We performed detailed sequence comparisons of the proteins that fulfill indispensable functions in DNA replication and classified them into four main categories with respect to the conservation in bacteria and archaea/eukaryotes: (i) non-homologous, such as replicative polymerases and primases; (ii) containing homologous domains but apparently non-orthologous and conceivably independently recruited to function in replication, such as the principal replicative helicases or proofreading exonucleases; (iii) apparently orthologous but poorly conserved, such as the sliding clamp proteins or DNA ligases; (iv) orthologous and highly conserved, such as clamp-loader ATPases or 5'--{$>$}3' exonucleases (FLAP nucleases). The universal conservation of some components of the DNA replication machinery and enzymes for DNA precursor biosynthesis but not the principal DNA polymerases suggests that the last common ancestor (LCA) of all modern cellular life forms possessed DNA but did not replicate it the way extant cells do. We propose that the LCA had a genetic system that contained both RNA and DNA, with the latter being produced by reverse transcription. Consequently, the modern-type system for double-stranded DNA replication likely evolved independently in the bacterial and archaeal/eukaryotic lineages.},

  abstract = {Is Big Data science a whole new way of doing research? And what difference does data quantity make to knowledge production strategies and their outputs? I argue that the novelty of Big Data science does not lie in the sheer quantity of data involved, but rather in (1) the prominence and status acquired by data as commodity and recognised output, both within and outside of the scientific community and (2) the methods, infrastructures, technologies, skills and knowledge developed to handle data. These developments generate the impression that data-intensive research is a new mode of doing science, with its own epistemology and norms. To assess this claim, one needs to consider the ways in which data are actually disseminated and used to generate knowledge. Accordingly, this article reviews the development of sophisticated ways to disseminate, integrate and re-use data acquired on model organisms over the last three decades of work in experimental biology. I focus on online databases as prominent infrastructures set up to organise and interpret such data and examine the wealth and diversity of expertise, resources and conceptual scaffolding that such databases draw upon. This illuminates some of the conditions under which Big Data needs to be curated to support processes of discovery across biological subfields, which in turn highlights the difficulties caused by the lack of adequate curation for the vast majority of data in the life sciences. In closing, I reflect on the difference that data quantity is making to contemporary biology, the methodological and epistemic challenges of identifying and analysing data given these developments, and the opportunities and worries associated with Big Data discourse and methods.},

The study then employed co-word analysis to identify the evolution of research themes over time in both fields. The comparison of social media research between the two fields highlighted four similarities, including the growth of research over time, the term ``social media'' gaining popularity, the new trend of social networking sites, and managerial applications as research focus. Finally, the study called for a future research agenda on social media research in the hospitality/tourism field.},

  abstract = {Changes in technology have made it possible to gather vast amounts of data, often of high quality, that in turn can improve the quality of wildlife biology. However, with this growth in data, practices such as data management, exploratory data analysis, data-sharing, and reproducibility of an analysis have become increasingly complex. These practices often depend heavily on computer scripting languages, and are often hidden from the peer-review process despite their influence on the final results. Although these issues have been discussed in the literature, they are generally dealt with in a piecemeal fashion, preventing synthesis, and thereby slowing progress. We offer a conceptual framework to illustrate relationships among these practices, and show where wildlife biology as a field has embraced these changes, where awareness is growing, and where it lags behind other fields. We then present several case studies to emphasize the importance of adopting these practices. Any of these case studies could have been conducted with little attention to these practices or employing scripting languages, but there are many disadvantages to this approach including increased chance of errors, inefficiency, and lack of reproducibility. We suggest that a change in the culture of how wildlife biology is conducted is required and that this change will be fostered by integrating these practices into wildlife biology education, implementation, and embracing the idea of open data and open computer code. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

In this work we propose a unified approach to measure the reproducibility of findings identified from replicate experiments and identify putative discoveries using reproducibility. Unlike the usual scalar measures of reproducibility, our approach creates a curve, which quantitatively assesses when the findings are no longer consistent across replicates. Our curve is fitted by a copula mixture model, from which we derive a quantitative reproducibility score, which we call the "irreproducible discovery rate" (IDR) analogous to the FDR. This score can be computed at each set of paired replicate ranks and permits the principled setting of thresholds both for assessing reproducibility and combining replicates. Since our approach permits an arbitrary scale for each replicate, it provides useful descriptive measures in a wide variety of situations to be explored. We study the performance of the algorithm using simulations and give a heuristic analysis of its theoretical properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a ChIP-seq experiment.},

At the same time we can see that complexity of those analyses increases fast due to a) enormous volumes of datasets being analyzed, b) variety of techniques and algorithms one have to check inside a single analysis, c) distributed nature of research teams that requires special communication media for knowledge and information exchange between individual researchers. There is a lot of resemblance between techniques and problems arising in the areas of industrial information retrieval and particle physics. To address those problems we propose Reproducible Experiment Platform (REP), a software infrastructure to support collaborative ecosystem for computational science.

Several analysis using Key features of REP are illustrated on several practical cases that were performed at LHCb experiment at CERN.},

Analysis of COVID-19 publications from December 1, 2019, to April 30, 2020, was conducted through the PubMed Central repository to evaluate the research data available through its publication as supplementary material or deposited in repositories. The PubMed Central search generated 5,905 records, of which 804 papers included complementary research data, especially as supplementary material (77.4\%). The most productive journals were The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet and The Lancet Infectious Diseases, the most frequent keyword was pneumonia, and the most used repositories were GitHub and GenBank. An expected growth in the number of published articles following the course of the pandemics is confirmed in this work, while the underlying research data are only 13.6\%. It can be deduced that data sharing is not a common practice, even in health emergencies, such as the present one. High-impact generalist journals have accounted for a large share of global publishing. The topics most often covered are related to epidemiological and public health concepts, genetics, virology and respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia. However, it is essential to interpret these data with caution following the evolution of publications and their funding in the coming months.},

  abstract = {Citation analysis has been a prevalent method in the field of information science, especially research on bibliometrics and evaluation, but its validity relies heavily on how the citations are treated. It is essential to study authors' citing motivations to identify citations with different values and significance. This study applied a meta-synthesis approach to establish a new holistic classification of citation motivations based on previous studies. First, we used a four-step search strategy to identify related articles on authors' citing motivations. Thirty-eight primary studies were included after the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and appraised using the Evidence-based Librarianship checklist. Next, we decoded and recoded the citing motivations found in the included studies, following the standard procedures of meta-synthesis. Thirty-five descriptive concepts of citation motivations emerged, which were then synthesized into 13 analytic themes. As a result, we proposed a comprehensive classification, including two main categories of citing reasons, i.e., ``scientific motivations'' and ``tactical motivations.'' Generally, the citations driven by scientific motivations serve as a rhetorical function, while tactical motivations are social or benefit-oriented and not easily captured through text-parsing. Our synthesis contributes to bibliometric and scientific evaluation theory. The synthesized classification also provides a comprehensive and unified annotation schema for citation classification and helps identify the useful mentions of a reference in a citing paper to optimize citation- based measurements.},

This expansion is both quantitative, including the discovery of diverse new examples of known types of defense systems, such as restriction-modification or toxin-antitoxin systems, and qualitative, including the discovery of fundamentally new defense mechanisms, such as the CRISPR-Cas immunity system. Large-scale statistical analysis reveals that the distribution of different defense systems in bacterial and archaeal taxa is non-uniform, with four groups of organisms distinguishable with respect to the overall abundance and the balance between specific types of defense systems. The genes encoding defense system components in bacterial and archaea typically cluster in defense islands. In addition to genes encoding known defense systems, these islands contain numerous uncharacterized genes, which are candidates for new types of defense systems. The tight association of the genes encoding immunity systems and dormancy- or cell death-inducing defense systems in prokaryotic genomes suggests that these two major types of defense are functionally coupled, providing for effective protection at the population level.},

  abstract = {The elaborate eukaryotic DNA replication machinery evolved from the archaeal ancestors that themselves show considerable complexity. Here we discuss the comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of the core replication enzymes, the DNA polymerases, in archaea and their relationships with the eukaryotic polymerases. In archaea, there are three groups of family B DNA polymerases, historically known as PolB1, PolB2 and PolB3. All three groups appear to descend from the last common ancestors of the extant archaea but their subsequent evolutionary trajectories seem to have been widely different. Although PolB3 is present in all archaea, with the exception of Thaumarchaeota, and appears to be directly involved in lagging strand replication, the evolution of this gene does not follow the archaeal phylogeny, conceivably due to multiple horizontal transfers and/or dramatic differences in evolutionary rates. In contrast, PolB1 is missing in Euryarchaeota but otherwise seems to have evolved vertically. The third archaeal group of family B polymerases, PolB2, includes primarily proteins in which the catalytic centers of the polymerase and exonuclease domains are disrupted and accordingly the enzymes appear to be inactivated. The members of the PolB2 group are scattered across archaea and might be involved in repair or regulation of replication along with inactivated members of the RadA family ATPases and an additional, uncharacterized protein that are encoded within the same predicted operon. In addition to the family B polymerases, all archaea, with the exception of the Crenarchaeota, encode enzymes of a distinct family D the origin of which is unclear. We examine multiple considerations that appear compatible with the possibility that family D polymerases are highly derived homologs of family B. The eukaryotic DNA polymerases show a highly complex relationship with their archaeal ancestors including contributions of proteins and domains from both the family B and the fam},

We report an update of the collection of archaeal Clusters of Orthologous Genes (arCOGs) to cover, on average, 91\% of the protein-coding genes in 168 archaeal genomes. The new arCOGs were constructed using refined algorithms for orthology identification combined with extensive manual curation, including incorporation of the results of several completed and ongoing research projects in archaeal genomics. A new level of classification is introduced, superclusters that untie two or more arCOGs and more completely reflect gene family evolution than individual, disconnected arCOGs. Assessment of the current archaeal genome annotation in public databases indicates that consistent use of arCOGs can significantly improve the annotation quality. In addition to their utility for genome annotation, arCOGs also are a platform for phylogenomic analysis. We explore this aspect of arCOGs by performing a phylogenomic study of the Thermococci that are traditionally viewed as the basal branch of the Euryarchaeota. The results of phylogenomic analysis that involved both comparison of multiple phylogenetic trees and a search for putative derived shared characters by using phyletic patterns extracted from the arCOGs reveal a likely evolutionary relationship between the Thermococci, Methanococci, and Methanobacteria. The arCOGs are expected to be instrumental for a comprehensive phylogenomic study of the archaea.},

It is believed that altmetrics can capture social and academic impacts, going beyond measures obtained using bibliometric and scientometric indicators. This research aimed to analyse aspects, characteristics and potentialities for the measuring of the social impact provided by altmetrics in social media. Method: 100 papers with higher altmetric scores were gathered from SciELO's database using the altmetric.com tool. Analysis: Profiles from individuals on Facebook and Twitter acting or reacting to the papers were analysed. These profiles were categorized as Social Impact and Academic Impact. Results: The results strongly indicate the impact measured using altmetrics greatly reproduces the scientist-to-scientist relation, as do bibliometrics and scientometrics. Conclusion: The social impact measured by actions and interactions on Facebook and Twitter reach a significant 36\%, attesting the potentiality of altmetrics for measurement, in addition to the academic impact and the impact of scientific results in society.},

Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99).

  abstract = {Background: Pyruvate kinase (PK) plays a major role in the regulation of glycolysis. Its catalytic activity is controlled by the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and by one or more allosteric effectors. The crystal structures of the non-allosteric PKs from cat and rabbit muscle are known. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the allosteric type I PK from Escherichia coli, in order to study the mechanism of allosteric regulation. Results The 2.5 \aa{} resolution crystal structure of the unligated type I PK in the inactive T-state shows that each subunit of the homotetrameric enzyme comprises a ({$\beta$}/{$\alpha$})8-barrel domain, a flexible {$\beta$}-barrel domain and a C-terminal domain. The allosteric and active sites are located at the domain interfaces. Comparison of the T-state E. coli PK with the non-allosteric muscle enzyme, which is thought to adopt a conformation similar to the active R-state, reveals differences in the orientations of the {$\beta$}-barrel and C-terminal domains of each subunit, which are rotated by 17\textdegree{} and 15\textdegree, respectively. Moreover, the relative orientation of the four subunits differs by about 16\textdegree{} in the two enzymes. Highly conserved residues at the subunit interfaces couple these movements to conformational changes in the substrate and allosteric effector binding sites. The subunit rotations observed in the T-state PK induce a shift in loop 6 of the ({$\beta$}/{$\alpha$})8-barrel domain, leading to a distortion of the phosphoenolpyruvate-binding site accounting for the low substrate affinity of the T-state enzyme. Conclusion Our results suggest that allosteric control of PK is accomplished through remarkable domain and subunit rotations. On transition from the T- to the R-state all 12 domains of the functional tetramer modify their relative orientations. These concerted motions are the molecular basis of the coupling between the active centre and the allosteric site.},

  abstract = {Objective: Like all scientific research, computational neuroscience research must be reproducible. Big data science, including simulation research, cannot depend exclusively on journal articles as the method to provide the sharing and transparency required for reproducibility. Methods: Ensuring model reproducibility requires the use of multiple standard software practices and tools, including version control, strong commenting and documentation, and code modularity. Results: Building on these standard practices, model-sharing sites and tools have been developed that fit into several categories: 1) standardized neural simulators; 2) shared computational resources; 3) declarative model descriptors, ontologies, and standardized annotations; and 4) model-sharing repositories and sharing standards. Conclusion: A number of complementary innovations have been proposed to enhance sharing, transparency, and reproducibility. The individual user can be encouraged to make use of version control, commenting, documentation, and modularity in development of models. The community can help by requiring model sharing as a condition of publication and funding. Significance: Model management will become increasingly important as multiscale models become larger, more detailed, and correspondingly more difficult to manage by any single investigator or single laboratory. Additional big data management complexity will come as the models become more useful in interpreting experiments, thus increasing the need to ensure clear alignment between modeling data, both parameters and results, and experiment.},

As an omics science, which generates vast amounts of data and relies heavily on data science for deriving biological meaning, metabolomics is highly vulnerable to irreproducibility. The metabolomics community has made substantial efforts to align with FAIR data standards by promoting open data formats, data repositories, online spectral libraries, and metabolite databases. Open data analysis platforms also exist; however, they tend to be inflexible and rely on the user to adequately report their methods and results. To enable FAIR data science in metabolomics, methods and results need to be transparently disseminated in a manner that is rapid, reusable, and fully integrated with the published work. To ensure broad use within the community such a framework also needs to be inclusive and intuitive for both computational novices and experts alike.},

A burgeoning number of scientific leaders believe the current system of faculty incentives and rewards is misaligned with the needs of society and disconnected from the evidence about the causes of the reproducibility crisis and suboptimal quality of the scientific publication record. To address this issue, particularly for the clinical and life sciences, we convened a 22-member expert panel workshop in Washington, DC, in January 2017. Twenty-two academic leaders, funders, and scientists participated in the meeting. As background for the meeting, we completed a selective literature review of 22 key documents critiquing the current incentive system. From each document, we extracted how the authors perceived the problems of assessing science and scientists, the unintended consequences of maintaining the status quo for assessing scientists, and details of their proposed solutions. The resulting table was used as a seed for participant discussion. This resulted in six principles for assessing scientists and associated research and policy implications. We hope the content of this paper will serve as a basis for establishing best practices and redesigning the current approaches to assessing scientists by the many players involved in that process.},

Changing the publishing model can influence the decision of authors to submit their papers to a journal, and increased article accessibility may influence citation behaviour. In this paper we aimed to understand how flipping a journal to an OA model influences the journal's future publication volumes and citation impact. We analysed two independent sets of journals that had flipped to an OA model, one from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and one from the Open Access Directory (OAD), and compared their development with two respective control groups of similar journals. For bibliometric analyses, journals were matched to the Scopus database. We assessed changes in the number of articles published over time, as well as two citation metrics at the journal and article level: the normalised impact factor (IF) and the average relative citations (ARC), respectively. Our results show that overall, journals that flipped to an OA model increased their publication output compared to journals that remained closed. Mean normalised IF and ARC also generally increased following the flip to an OA model, at a greater rate than was observed in the control groups. However, the changes appear to vary largely by scientific discipline. Overall, these results indicate that flipping to an OA publishing model can bring positive changes to a journal.},

  abstract = {The recent discovery of diverse very large viruses, such as the mimivirus, has fostered a profusion of hypotheses positing that these viruses define a new domain of life together with the three cellular ones (Archaea, Bacteria and Eucarya). It has also been speculated that they have played a key role in the origin of eukaryotes as donors of important genes or even as the structures at the origin of the nucleus. Thanks to the increasing availability of genome sequences for these giant viruses, those hypotheses are amenable to testing via comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses. This task is made very difficult by the high evolutionary rate of viruses, which induces phylogenetic artefacts, such as long branch attraction, when inadequate methods are applied. It can be demonstrated that phylogenetic trees supporting viruses as a fourth domain of life are artefactual. In most cases, the presence of homologues of cellular genes in viruses is best explained by recurrent horizontal gene transfer from cellular hosts to their infecting viruses and not the opposite. Today, there is no solid evidence for the existence of a viral domain of life or for a significant implication of viruses in the origin of the cellular domains.},

  abstract = {The canonical frameworks of viral evolution describe viruses as cellular predecessors, reduced forms of cells, or entities that escaped cellular control. The discovery of giant viruses has changed these standard paradigms. Their genetic, proteomic and structural complexities resemble those of cells, prompting a redefinition and reclassification of viruses. In a previous genome-wide analysis of the evolution of structural domains in proteomes, with domains defined at the fold superfamily level, we found the origins of viruses intertwined with those of ancient cells. Here, we extend these data-driven analyses to the study of fold families confirming the co-evolution of viruses and ancient cells and the genetic ability of viruses to foster molecular innovation. The results support our suggestion that viruses arose by genomic reduction from ancient cells and validate a co-evolutionary `symbiogenic' model of viral origins.},

  abstract = {Diversos indicadores bibliom\'etricos t\^em sido empregados na avalia\c{c}\~ao de desempenho de pesquisadores, universidades e pa\'ises. Indicadores de impacto, calculados a partir das cita\c{c}\~oes recebidas pelos artigos, t\^em sido objeto de muitos estudos constantes da pesquisa document\'aria. Dessa maneira, almeja-se apontar poss\'iveis formas de adequa\c{c}\~ao da an\'alise do impacto de revistas brasileiras com vistas ao aprimoramento dos crit\'erios de avalia\c{c}\~ao de produ\c{c}\~ao cient\'ifica no Brasil. Objetivos. A pesquisa foi conduzida de acordo com tr\^es objetivos: (1) Verificar se o uso exclusivo de indicadores internacionais deixa a pol\'itica cient\'ifica brasileira fora do contexto de sua realidade local, e se o acesso \`as revistas indexadas nas bases do ISI (Thomson Scientific) tem se justificado pelo uso ? o acesso gratuito aos textos completos \'e oferecido \`a comunidade cient\'ifica pela Capes (Coordena\c{c}\~ao de Aperfei\c{c}oamento de Pessoal de N\'ivel Superior). (2) Investigar se a base SciELO pode oferecer indicadores de impacto da produ\c{c}\~ao cient\'ifica brasileira com vistas ao aprimoramento da avalia\c{c}\~ao cient\'ifica nacional. (3) Buscar propor metodologias de indicadores mais adequadas \`a realidade da ci\^encia brasileira. Metodologia. Foi conduzido um estudo explorat\'orio quantitativo, baseados em caracter\'isticas qualitativas e quantitativas de revistas cient\'ificas provenientes de tr\^es fontes: revistas classificadas pela Avalia\c{c}\~ao Qualis (tri\^enio 2001/2003), revistas do Portal de Peri\'odicos da Capes e revistas indexadas na base SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library). Uma compara\c{c}\~ao do impacto nacional e internacional de um conjunto de revistas brasileiras indexadas na base SciELO foi realizada a partir das cita\c{c}\~oes recebidas pelas revistas em cada contexto (base SciELO e as bases do ISI). Uma metodologia de an\'alise de revistas foi apresentada aplicando-se t\'ecnicas de an\'alise estat\'istica multivariada a um conjunto de 42 indicadores. Resultados. A an\'alise da Avalia\c{c}\~ao Qualis mostrou que os crit\'erios definidos favorecem principalmente a publica\c{c}\~ao em revistas internacionais e fazem uso do Fator de Impacto do ISI. O Impacto P\'os-Portal, como foi denominado, indicou um efeito positivo, notado pelo aumento da m\'edia de cita\c{c}\~oes recebidas na SciELO, por aproximadamente 70\% das revistas da amostra (Ci\^encias da Vida), ap\'os o ano de publica\c{c}\~ao no Portal. A compara\c{c}\~ao do impacto nacional versus internacional das revistas SciELO mostrou que revistas indexadas tamb\'em no ISI s\~ao citadas com mais freq\"u\^encia naquela base, al\'em de receberem aproximadamente 72\% das cita\c{c}\~oes de revistas ISI de autores estrangeiros e terem os artigos em colabora\c{c}\~ao (nacional e internacional) mais citados que aqueles em autoria \'unica. Em rela\c{c}\~ao \`as revistas publicadas somente na SciELO, verificou-se que s\~ao citadas em quantidades similares naquela base e nas bases do ISI, recebem 68\% das cita\c{c}\~oes de revistas ISI de autores estrangeiros e t\^em seus artigos de autoria \'unica mais citados, seguidos daqueles em colabora\c{c}\~ao nacional. A an\'alise multivariada dos indicadores das revistas SciELO permitiu a identifica\c{c}\~ao de diferentes grupos de revistas, discriminados de acordo com as diferentes pr\'aticas de comunica\c{c}\~ao cient\'ifica. Conclus\~oes. A adequa\c{c}\~ao dos crit\'erios utilizados na avalia\c{c}\~ao da produ\c{c}\~ao cient\'ifica nacional pode ser conseguida considerando-se indicadores de impacto mensurados a partir de cita\c{c}\~oes provenientes das revistas nacionais, definindo crit\'erios que valorizem a publica\c{c}\~ao em revistas nacionais de qualidade reconhecida, o que permitir\'a a publica\c{c}\~ao de trabalhos importantes na l\'ingua portuguesa, e estimular\'a o processo de melhoria de qualidade das revistas nacionais.},

Therefore, provided an overview based on the types of assessment criteria adopted in the Qualis-Peri\'odicos for the definition of strata A1, A2 and B1, from the documents of 2010-2012 period. It found that most hard sciences areas presents evaluation profile strictly based on bibliometric indicators, mainly JCR impact factor and in some cases, the h-index. Humanities, Social and Language, Literature and Arts areas, serve themselves believing at the selection process carried out by the databases, especially the citation indexes (Web of Science, Scopus and SciELO), and also in other databases as RedALyC and Latindex when defining criteria of journal indexing. Finally, periodic characteristics are primarily institutional diversity of authors and authors from foreign institutions, followed by journal periodicity and diversity of the editorial board. Thus configures itself an evaluation cycle, whose result appears to contribute to the improvement of the journals. On the other hand, although mounted, the process needs review, so that one can assess their effects on the scientific communication process.},

This study analyses the use of DOIs in the cited references of articles by authors from Brazilian institutions, their possible influencing factors and differences among areas of knowledge. It measures the extent to which the citation datasets are open for reuse by others in terms of the availability of DOIs. 226,491 articles were retrieved from Web of Science (2012\textendash 2016), making a total of 8,707,120 cited references, 68\% of which include DOIs. The results showed that the hard sciences have higher percentages of DOIs in their cited references. The factor type of collaboration showed higher percentages when there is international collaboration, being significantly different from the other categories. However, when the analysis was conducted inside the areas, the international collaboration was found to be different particularly in the soft sciences and a couple of other areas. The articles with DOI attributed, as well as those with mention of research funding, had a significantly higher percentage, even in the interaction with the areas of knowledge. Among the open access routes the green routes showed the highest percentages, followed by golden (DOAJ and other) and Bronze, but green routes articles proved to be not significantly different from those not openly accessible. Finally, the principal collaborating countries also showed the greatest influence on the DOI attribution, with the exception of Peru and South Africa. Our findings provide evidence that studies on the availability and usability of DOIs can assist researchers, by underlining the importance of making greater use of this persistent identifier, as well as to provide consistency to citation analysis.},

In this article we bring together three qualitative research projects undertaken in the Netherlands and Austria to contribute to filling this gap. The projects explored the role of performance metrics in the life sciences, and the interactions between institutional and disciplinary cultures of evaluating research in these fields. Our analytic perspective is focused on understanding how researchers themselves give value to research, and in how far these practices are related to performance metrics. The article zooms in on three key moments in research processes to show how `thinking with indicators' is becoming a central aspect of research activities themselves: (1) the planning and conception of research projects, (2) the social organization of research processes, and (3) determining the endpoints of research processes. Our findings demonstrate how the worth of research activities becomes increasingly assessed and defined by their potential to yield high value in quantitative terms. The analysis makes visible how certain norms and values related to performance metrics are stabilized as they become integrated into routine practices of knowledge production. Other norms and criteria for scientific quality, e.g. epistemic originality, long-term scientific progress, societal relevance, and social responsibility, receive less attention or become redefined through their relations to quantitative indicators. We understand this trend to be in tension with policy goals that seek to encourage innovative, societally relevant, and responsible research.},

Here, we focus on the distribution of viral replicons in host organisms, their morphological features, and the evolution of highly conserved protein and nucleic acid structures. The apparent inability of RNA viral replicons to infect contemporary akaryotic species suggests an early origin of RNA viruses and their subsequent loss in akaryotes. A census of virion morphotypes reveals that advanced forms were unique to viruses infecting a specific supergroup, while simpler forms were observed in viruses infecting organisms in all forms of cellular life. Results hint toward an ancient origin of viruses from an ancestral virus harboring either filamentous or spherical virions. Finally, phylogenetic trees built from protein domain and tRNA structures in thousands of genomes suggest that viruses evolved via reductive evolution from ancient cells. The analysis presents a complete account of the evolutionary history of cells and viruses and identifies viruses as crucial agents influencing cellular evolution.},

The core machineries that copy DNA are conserved in all three domains of life: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. This article outlines the general nature of the DNA replication machinery, but also points out important and key differences. The most complex organisms, eukaryotes, have to coordinate the initiation of DNA replication from many origins in each genome and impose regulation that maintains genomic integrity, not only for the sake of each cell, but for the organism as a whole. In addition, DNA replication in eukaryotes needs to be coordinated with inheritance of chromatin, developmental patterning of tissues, and cell division to ensure that the genome replicates once per cell division cycle.},

  abstract = {The journal impact factor (JIF) for The Annals of Occupational Hygiene rose 68\% between 2005 and 2006. JIFs are widely publicized and may influence subscriptions and where authors submit papers, so they are much discussed in the publishing world. But although they tell us something about a journal's citation performance, their shortcomings mean that they are poor general indicators of journal quality, and worse guides to the quality of authors and their institutions. The shortcomings include the following. (i) The two cited years may completely misrepresent the total current citation rate for the journal. (ii) The short citation period (1 year) results in many papers not contributing to the JIF, and usually two-thirds or more of the JIF depend on the most-cited 25\% of papers. (iii) The JIF of the journal where a paper is published is therefore a very poor guide to the paper's citation performance or the success of the author. Citation counts more specific to the author are much better. (iv) The JIF depends strongly on the subject of the journal, even within the published categories. (v) Statistical analysis shows that the relative standard deviation of year-to-year variation of a JIF for a journal with a JIF {$\sim$}1.5 is likely to be between 10 and 20\%, on top of any longer trend. Quotation of JIFs to three decimal places is therefore meaningless, and, for a journal like Annals of Occupational Hygiene, a single annual change of 70\% could easily be due to a chance shift from a negative to positive fluctuation. (vi) The citations counted are not only of individual papers, so it is difficult to reproduce the JIF calculation. (vii) The selection of journals has been criticized, for example, the alleged emphasis on American- or English-language publications. This journal's JIF does not noticeably influence the number of papers submitted to this journal, although it may influence some important authors. JIFs in our field seem to be increasing by {$\sim$}5\% a year, perhaps partly because of the various measures which editors can take to improve them, some of which represent genuine improvements to the journal, but some of which are unethical.},

A quarta se\c{c}\~ao versa sobre as causas da epidemia, introduz uma distin\c{c}\~ao entre produtivismo e producionismo e prop\~oe uma an\'alise das formas como o produtivismo fomenta as m\'as condutas. A quinta consiste em uma cr\'itica ao tratamento moralizador, fundamentada em suas inadequa\c{c}\~oes, principalmente sua inefic\'acia.

In spite of marked differences between its national varieties, a common characteristic of this species can be found in the global monopolisation of knowledge. This monopolisation involves hierarchical relations among firms and between capital and labour, because the capital of some firms includes the exclusive ownership of much of the knowledge used in production. Since the 1994 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreements, the growing commoditisation of knowledge has extended the role of closed science and closed markets at the expense of open science and open markets. The intrinsic long-term dynamics of this species of capitalism is increasingly characterised by financialisation, inequality and stagnation. In order to exit from the current crisis, we must change many features of intellectual monopoly capitalism and rely on an eclectic approach that draws insights from liberal, Keynesian and Marxian traditions.},

This allows us to understand the predominant mention and citation practices surrounding these tools.

Overall, we find that researchers mention and cite the tools in diverse ways, many of which fall short of a traditional formal citation. Our results further indicate a clear upward trend in the use of all three tools, though VOSviewer is more frequently used than CiteSpace or HistCite. We also find that these three software tools have seen the fastest and most widespread adoption in library and information science research, where the tools originated. They have since been gradually adopted in other areas of study, initially at a lower diffusion speed but afterward at a rapidly growing rate.},

We used generalized linear mixed modeling to estimate the relative effects of Twitter activity, journal impact factor, and time since publication on Web of Science citation rates of 1,599 primary research articles from 20 ecology journals published from 2012\textendash 2014. We found a strong positive relationship between Twitter activity (i.e., the number of unique tweets about an article) and number of citations. Twitter activity was a more important predictor of citation rates than 5-year journal impact factor. Moreover, Twitter activity was not driven by journal impact factor; the `highest-impact' journals were not necessarily the most discussed online. The effect of Twitter activity was only about a fifth as strong as time since publication; accounting for this confounding factor was critical for estimating the true effects of Twitter use. Articles in impactful journals can become heavily cited, but articles in journals with lower impact factors can generate considerable Twitter activity and also become heavily cited. Authors may benefit from establishing a strong social media presence, but should not expect research to become highly cited solely through social media promotion. Our research demonstrates that altmetrics and traditional metrics can be closely related, but not identical. We suggest that both altmetrics and traditional citation rates can be useful metrics of research impact.},

By contrast, bacterial and eukaryal membrane phospholipids are fatty acid esters linked to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). The two key dehydrogenase enzymes that produce G1P and G3P, G1PDH and G3PDH, respectively, are not homologous. Various models propose that these enzymes originated during the speciation of the two prokaryotic domains, and the nature (and even the very existence) of lipid membranes in the last universal common ancestor (cenancestor) is subject to debate. G1PDH and G3PDH belong to two separate superfamilies that are universally distributed, suggesting that members of both superfamilies existed in the cenancestor. Furthermore, archaea possess homologues to known bacterial genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and synthesize fatty acid phospholipids. The cenancestor seems likely to have been endowed with membrane lipids whose synthesis was enzymatic but probably non-stereospecific.},

  abstract = {The tree of life shows the relationship between all organisms based on their common ancestry. Until 1977, it comprised two major branches: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Work by Carl Woese and other microbiologists led to the recategorization of prokaryotes and the proposal of three primary domains: Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea. Microbiological, genetic and biochemical techniques were then needed to study the third domain of life. Haloferax volcanii, a halophilic species belonging to the phylum Euryarchaeota, has provided many useful tools to study Archaea, including easy culturing methods, genetic manipulation and phenotypic screening. This review will focus on DNA replication and DNA repair pathways in H. volcanii, how this work has advanced our knowledge of archaeal cellular biology, and how it may deepen our understanding of bacterial and eukaryotic processes.},

They support the creation of literate programming documents that combine code, text, and execution results with visualizations and all sorts of rich media. The self-documenting aspects and the ability to reproduce results have been touted as significant benefits of notebooks. At the same time, there has been growing criticism that the way notebooks are being used leads to unexpected behavior, encourage poor coding practices, and that their results can be hard to reproduce. To understand good and bad practices used in the development of real notebooks, we studied 1.4 million notebooks from GitHub. We present a detailed analysis of their characteristics that impact reproducibility. We also propose a set of best practices that can improve the rate of reproducibility and discuss open challenges that require further research and development.},

The usual answer is that quantification is desirable in social investigation as a result of its successes in science. Trust in Numbers questions whether such success in the study of stars, molecules, or cells should be an attractive model for research on human societies, and examines why the natural sciences are highly quantitative in the first place. Theodore Porter argues that a better understanding of the attractions of quantification in business, government, and social research brings a fresh perspective to its role in psychology, physics, and medicine. Quantitative rigor is not inherent in science but arises from political and social pressures, and objectivity derives its impetus from cultural contexts. In a new preface, the author sheds light on the current infatuation with quantitative methods, particularly at the intersection of science and bureaucracy.},

The complexities of ecological observations and data present novel challenges in satisfying needs for reproducibility and also transparency. Ecological systems are dynamic and heterogeneous, interacting with numerous factors that sculpt natural history and that investigators cannot completely control. Observations may be highly dependent on spatial and temporal context, making them very difficult to reproduce, but computational reproducibility can still be achieved. Computational reproducibility often refers to the ability to produce equivalent analytical outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software as the original study. When coded workflows are shared, authors and editors provide transparency for readers and allow other researchers to build directly and efficiently on primary work. These qualities may be especially important in ecological applications that have important or controversial implications for science, management, and policy. Expectations for computational reproducibility and transparency are shifting rapidly in the sciences. In this work, we highlight many of the unique challenges for ecology along with practical guidelines for reproducibility and transparency, as ecologists continue to participate in the stewardship of critical environmental information and ensure that research methods demonstrate integrity.},

Theoretically there can be no dogmas in science, but it has been demonstrated that scientific thought operates by conceptual changes. A dogma therefore can be understood as a concept present at the heart of some contemporary research programmes that need to be altered to overcome paradigms. Here we argue that two ideas relating to emergence of the biological system research need to be re-evaluated. First, is the idea that research programmes about the emergence of the biological system are the same as those of the origin of cells. Cells are strikingly important biological entities, hard core concepts for the entire field of biology. The emergence of the biological system happened much earlier than the origin of cells and thus the First Universal Common Ancestor (FUCA) should be viewed as a great-grandfather to the Last Universal Cellular Ancestor Preprints (www.preprints.org) | NOT PEER-REVIEWED |},

  abstract = {Genes and gene trees have been extensively used to study the evolutionary relationships among populations, species, families and higher systematic clades of organisms. This brought modern Biology into a sophisticated level of understanding about the evolutionary relationships and diversification patterns that happened along the entire history of organismal evolution in Earth. Genes however have not been placed in the center of questions when one aims to unravel the evolutionary history of genes themselves. Thus, we still ignore whether Insulin share a more recent common ancestor to Hexokinase or DNA polymerase. This brought modern Genetics into a very poor level of understanding about sister group relationships that happened along the entire evolutionary history of genes. Many conceptual challenges must be overcome to allow this broader comprehension about gene evolution. Here we aim to clear the intellectual path in order to provide a fertile research program that will help geneticists to understand the deep ancestry and sister group relationships among different gene families (or orthologs). We aim to propose methods to study gene formation starting from the establishment of the genetic code in pre-cellular organisms like the FUCA (First Universal Common Ancestor) until the formation of the highly complex genome of LUCA (Last UCA), that harbors hundreds of genes families working coordinated into a cellular organism. The deep understanding of ancestral relationships among orthologs will certainly inspire biotechnological and biomedical approaches and allow a deep understanding about how Darwinian molecular evolution operates inside cells and before the appearance of cellular organisms.

  abstract = {The peptidyl transferase center (PTC) is the catalytic center of the ribosome and forms part of the 23S ribosomal RNA. The PTC has been recognized as the earliest ribosomal part and its origins embodied the First Universal Common Ancestor (FUCA). The PTC is frequently assumed to be highly conserved along all living beings. In this work, we posed the following questions: (i) How many 100\% conserved bases can be found in the PTC? (ii) Is it possible to identify clusters of informationally linked nucleotides along its sequence? (iii) Can we propose how the PTC was formed? (iv) How does sequence conservation reflect on the secondary and tertiary structures of the PTC? Aiming to answer these questions, all available complete sequences of 23S ribosomal RNA from Bacteria and Archaea deposited on GenBank database were downloaded. Using a sequence bait of 179 bp from the PTC of Thermus termophilus, we performed an optimum pairwise alignment to retrieve the PTC region from 1424 filtered 23S rRNA sequences. These PTC sequences were multiply aligned, and the conserved regions were assigned and observed along the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures. The PTC structure was observed to be more highly conserved close to the adenine located at the catalytical site. Clusters of interrelated, co-evolving nucleotides reinforce previous assumptions that the PTC was formed by the concatenation of proto-tRNAs and important residues responsible for its assembly were identified. The observed sequence variation does not seem to significantly affect the 3D structure of the PTC ribozyme.},

Chemical symbiosis emerged when RNA-like nucleic acid polymers happened to fold into 3D structures capable to bind amino acids together, forming a proto peptidyl-transferase center. This folding catalyzed the formation of quasi-random small peptides, some of them capable to bind this ribozyme structure back and starting to form an initial layer that would produce the larger subunit of the ribosome by accretion. TCS suggests that there is no chicken-and-egg problem into the emergence of biological systems as RNAs and peptides were of equal importance to the origin of life. Life has initially emerged when these two macromolecules started to interact in molecular symbiosis. Further, we suggest that life evolved into progenotes and cells due to the emergence of new layers of symbiosis. Mutualism is the strongest force in biology, capable to create novelties by emergent principles; on which the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts.

Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow. Findings: Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

In the field of Education, the same can be observed, with a significant growth in the number of articles published by Brazilian researchers in the recent past. In this article we evaluate Brazilian research output in Education from 2007 to 2016, with the intent to understand how national evaluation standards compare with international parameters dictated by bibliometric indicators. We confront the citation impact of Brazilian publications in the period with their classification in an expert-based journal evaluation system called QUALIS. We used Scopus' SNIP bibliometric indicator for this analysis. The study was carried out using data about 40,825 articles published in 2719 different journals. Results showed that only a small percentage of these articles featured in Scopus indexed journals (13.28\%), and most of these journals were published in Brazil (66\%). The citation impact of the Scopus indexed publications had a significant growth in the period, but journals with dissimilar citation impact were not distinctively distributed in separate QUALIS categories. These findings show a certain publishing pattern that is likely to be related to the association of the Brazilian research evaluation and funding systems. In addition, they raise questions about how the establishment of evaluation criteria that is mainly subjective and does not include specific metrics may hinder the visibility of research output from a global perspective.},

Gyrase belongs to a class of enzymes known as topoisomerases that are involved in the control of topological transitions of DNA. The mechanism by which gyrase is able to influence the topological state of DNA molecules is of inherent interest from an enzymological standpoint. In addition, much attention has been focused on DNA gyrase as the intracellular target of a number of antibacterial agents and as a paradigm for other DNA topoisomerases. In this review we summarize the current knowledge concerning DNA gyrase by addressing a wide range of aspects of the study of this enzyme.},

Through population-scale comparative genomics of 7 Sulfolobus islandicus genomes from 3 locations, we demonstrate the biogeographical structure of the pan-genome of this species, with no evidence of gene flow between geographically isolated populations. The evolutionary independence of each population allowed us to assess genome dynamics over very recent evolutionary time, beginning {$\approx$}910,000 years ago. On this time scale, genome variation largely consists of recent strain-specific integration of mobile elements. Localized sectors of parallel gene loss are identified; however, the balance between the gain and loss of genetic material suggests that S. islandicus genomes acquire material slowly over time, primarily from closely related Sulfolobus species. Examination of the genome dynamics through population genomics in S. islandicus exposes the process of allopatric speciation in thermophilic Archaea and brings us closer to a generalized framework for understanding microbial genome evolution in a spatial context.},

The literature on evaluation systems, practices, and effects of indicator uses is extremely heterogeneous: it comprises hundreds of sources published in different media, spread over disciplines, and with considerable variation in the nature of the evidence. A condensation of the state-of-the-art in relevant research is therefore highly timely. Our review presents the main strands in the literature, with a focus on empirical materials about possible effects of evaluation exercises, `gaming' of indicators, and strategic responses by scientific communities and others to requirements in research assessments.

We distinguish between migrants--authors who have ruptures with their country of origin--and travelers--authors who gain additional affiliations while maintaining affiliation with their country of origin. We find that 3.7\% of researchers who have published at least one paper over the period are mobile. Travelers represent 72.7\% of all mobile scholars, but migrants have higher scientific impact. We apply this classification at the country level, expanding the classification to incorporate the directionality of scientists' mobility (i.e., incoming and outgoing). We provide a brief analysis to highlight the utility of the proposed taxonomy to study scholarly mobility and discuss the implications for science policy.},

  abstract = {Using comparative analysis of genes, operons, and regulatory elements, we describe the cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthetic pathway in available prokaryotic genomes. Here we found a highly conserved RNA secondary structure, the regulatory B12 element, which is widely distributed in the upstream regions of cobalamin biosynthetic/transport genes in eubacteria. In addition, the binding signal (CBL-box) for a hypothetical B12 regulator was identified in some archaea. A search for B12 elements and CBL-boxes and positional analysis identified a large number of new candidate B12-regulated genes in various prokaryotes. Among newly assigned functions associated with the cobalamin biosynthesis, there are several new types of cobalt transporters, ChlI and ChlD subunits of the CobN-dependent cobaltochelatase complex, cobalt reductase BluB, adenosyltransferase PduO, several new proteins linked to the lower ligand assembly pathway, l-threonine kinase PduX, and a large number of other hypothetical proteins. Most missing genes detected within the cobalamin biosynthetic pathways of various bacteria were identified as nonorthologous substitutes. The variable parts of the cobalamin metabolism appear to be the cobalt transport and insertion, the CobG/CbiG- and CobF/CbiD-catalyzed reactions, and the lower ligand synthesis pathway. The most interesting result of analysis of B12 elements is that B12-independent isozymes of the methionine synthase and ribonucleotide reductase are regulated by B12 elements in bacteria that have both B12-dependent and B12-independent isozymes. Moreover, B12 regulons of various bacteria are thought to include enzymes from known B12-dependent or alternative pathways.},

This paper aims to provide a brief review of the current bibliometric tools used by authors and editors and proposes an algorithm to assess the relevance of the most common bibliometric tools to help the researchers select the fittest journal and know the trends of published submissions by using self-evaluation. Methods We present a narrative review answering at least two related consecutive questions triggered by the topics mentioned above. How prestigious is a journal based on its most recent bibliometrics, so authors may choose it to submit their next manuscript? And, how can they self-evaluate/understand the impact of their whole publishing scientific life? Results We presented the main relevant definitions of each bibliometrics and grouped them in those oriented to evaluated journals or individuals. Also, we share with our readers our algorithm to assess journals before manuscript submission. Conclusions Since there is a journal performance market and an article performance market, each one with its patterns, an integrative use of these metrics, rather than just the impact factor alone, might represent the fairest and most legitimate approach to assess the influence and importance of an acceptable research issue, and not only a sound journal in their respective disciplines.},

  abstract = {Enzymes of the gluconeogenic/glycolytic pathway (the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway), the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, the reductive pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway are widely distributed and are often considered to be central to the origins of metabolism. In particular, several enzymes of the lower portion of the EMP pathway (the so-called trunk pathway), including triosephosphate isomerase (TPI; EC 5.3.1.1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12/13), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK; EC 2.7.2.3) and enolase (EC 4.2.1.11), are extremely well conserved and universally distributed among the three domains of life. In this paper, the distribution of enzymes of gluconeogenesis/glycolysis in hyperthermophiles\textemdash microorganisms that many believe represent the least evolved organisms on the planet\textemdash is reviewed. In addition, the phylogenies of the trunk pathway enzymes (TPIs, GAPDHs, PGKs and enolases) are examined. The enzymes catalyzing each of the six-carbon transformations in the upper portion of the EMP pathway, with the possible exception of aldolase, are all derived from multiple gene sequence families. In contrast, single sequence families can account for the archaeal and hyperthermophilic bacterial enzyme activities of the lower portion of the EMP pathway. The universal distribution of the trunk pathway enzymes, in combination with their phylogenies, supports the notion that the EMP pathway evolved in the direction of gluconeogenesis, i.e., from the bottom up.},

I then address issues such as the world power structures, the social organization of developing countries, growing North/South disparities and the question of collaborative research.

I finally present a proposal, the aim of which is to suggest ways that could help scientists in periphery countries become fully integrated members of the worldwide network of science and would also contribute to the promotion of scientific multilingualism, a means for science to be truly universal, as it should be. I~conclude by arguing that science, technology and publication form a triad which is essential for the survival of developing nations, and that, although the complete elimination of inequities in the world of scholarship is unlikely, progress could be achieved if there were a universal will (i.e., a worldwide will at the institutional, governmental and intergovernmental levels) to redress the current North/South imbalance.},

There are thousands of journals and funding agencies across specialized disciplines with different requirements for data transparency. Science-focused domains substantiate research findings through defined research methods and data analysis techniques, and emerging practices around data storage and code publishing now allow other scientists to see exactly how researchers come to their conclusions. These new practices not only increase transparency of the scientific process, they also enable replication and derivative research. Despite these emerging practices, the work of research transparency does not always easily enable reproducibility. At face value, the requirements (e.g., America COMPETES Act; G8 Open Data Charter, etc.) for data sharing seem straightforward: a scientist receives funding and therefore is required to share her data with other scientists. However, the physical sciences and social sciences produce different kinds of data that are more or less easily stored. Additionally, in some cases, researchers can (and should) put restrictions on who can view their data, because of ethical concerns. This panel will begin with current reasons for and methods of sharing data, including national and global initiatives, then will move into problems with open data, sharing data and reproducibility in both quantitative and qualitative research.},

  abstract = {Peer-reviewed journal publication is the main means for academic researchers in the life sciences to create a permanent public record of their work. These publications are also the de facto currency for career progress, with a strong link between journal brand recognition and perceived value. The current peer-review process can lead to long delays between submission and publication, with cycles of rejection, revision, and resubmission causing redundant peer review. This situation creates unique challenges for early career researchers (ECRs), who rely heavily on timely publication of their work to gain recognition for their efforts. Today, ECRs face a changing academic landscape, including the increased interdisciplinarity of life sciences research, expansion of the researcher population, and consequent shifts in employer and funding demands. The publication of preprints, publicly available scientific manuscripts posted on dedicated preprint servers prior to journal-managed peer review, can play a key role in addressing these ECR challenges. Preprinting benefits include rapid dissemination of academic work, open access, establishing priority or concurrence, receiving feedback, and facilitating collaborations. Although there is a growing appreciation for and adoption of preprints, a minority of all articles in life sciences and medicine are preprinted. The current low rate of preprint submissions in life sciences and ECR concerns regarding preprinting need to be addressed. We provide a perspective from an interdisciplinary group of ECRs on the value of preprints and advocate their wide adoption to advance knowledge and facilitate career development.},

  abstract = {Abstract An important part of scientific research activities yield negative results \textendash{} non-confirmatory and null data, inconclusive experiments, unexpected data. These results permeate the entire research cycle and constitute an important part of the full scientific knowledge flow generation. However, despite the acknowledgment that it is the non-confirmatory findings that result in the rejection of consolidated hypotheses that drive the progress of science, most of these investigation routes are not documented. Growing competition for resources, tenure, and impact publications induces researchers to produce ``positive'' results that are more likely to be published, interfering with the principles of science reproducibility and self-correction and in the scientific communication cycle. This study aims to review negative results incorporation in the traditional academic publication cycle. It also seeks to identify and systematize the main barriers that prevent researchers from publishing negative results. This exploratory study is based methodologically on the scarce literature on the subject. It confirms the initial assumption that few scientific journals accept, edit special issues or are dedicated to the publication of negative results.},

In particular, it adamantly declared that Journal Impact Factor (JIF) should never be used as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research contributions, or for hiring, promotion, or funding decisions. Since then, a heightened awareness of the damaging practice of using JIFs as a proxy for the quality of individual papers, and to assess an individual's or institution's accomplishments has led to changes in policy and the design and application of best practices to more accurately assess the quality and impact of our research. Herein I summarize the considerable progress made and remaining challenges that must be met to ensure a fair and meritocratic approach to research assessment and the advancement of research.},

It is also important to bear in mind that without these corrections, for biases and sampling error the results of meta-analysis do not estimate the construct-level population relationships that are of greatest scientifi c and theoretical interest (Rubin 1990; Schmidt and Hunter 2004, chapters 1, 14). Hence, in meta-analysis, these corrections are essential to the development of valid cumulative knowledge about relations between constructs. This is especially important in light of recent developments concerning the use of meta-analytic results in the testing of causal models. Meta-analytic results are increasingly being used as input to path analyses and other causal modeling techniques. Without appropriate corrections for measurement error, range restriction, and other artifacts that bias meta-analysis results, these causal modeling procedures will produce erroneous results.},

This, in turn, prevents the successful reproduction of the analyses. Typical examples are missing scripts, incomplete datasets or specification of used software. Moreover, issues about licences often create legal concerns. This is true for the use of commercial software but also for the publication of research artefacts without proper sharing licence. As a result, the sole publication of research artefacts does not automatically result in reproducible research. To empirically confirm this, we have been systematically analysing research publications that also published their investigations as Jupyter notebooks. In this paper, we present preliminary results of this analysis for five publications.

Further independent evidence for the cellular origin of viruses is reviewed for the virus order Megavirales, focusing on the family Poxviridae. Megavirales comprises giant viruses, double-stranded DNA viruses whose genomes exceed some bacterial ones and large enough to parasitize large-celled protists (amoeba). Giant viruses, virophages, and mitochondria have homologous DNA and RNA polymerases and share RNA splicing punctuation by stem\textendash loop hairpins. Giant virus factories and amoeban mitochondria colocate, with viral proteins homologous to mitochondrial proteins specifically targeting mitochondrial inner membranes. Mitochondria share asexual budding with many bacterial endospores and membrane-enveloped viruses. These megavirus-mitochondrion similarities are not coincidental: systematic alignment analyses have detected candidate megaviral homologs of each amoeban mitogene (including ribosomal RNAs) distributed across megaviral genomes. These candidate megaviral homologs overall follow mitogene order, and megaviral-mitogenome synteny increases with viral genome reduction. This analysis is repeated within Poxviridae, whose organellar-like morphogenesis is reminiscent of mitochondria. More generally, the results confirm the patterns observed in Megavirales: synteny with amoeban mitogenomes increases with genome reduction. Parsimoniously interpreting this suggests Megavirales and mitochondria have a rickettsia-like common ancestor. Megavirales could be the missing links between bacterial-like cells and mitochondria, implying cellular-to-viral-to-subcellular macroevolution.},

Previously, we evolved Escherichia coli and the filamentous bacteriophage M13 in 96-well microplates, an environment in which the ancestral phage increased the growth rate and yield of the ancestral bacteria. In the majority of populations, mutualism was maintained or even enhanced between phages and coevolving bacteria; however, these same phages evolved traits that harmed the ancestral E. coli genotype. Here, we set out to determine if mutualism could evolve from this new parasitic interaction. To do so, we chose six evolved phage populations from the original experiment and used them to establish new infections of the ancestral bacteria. After 20 passages, mutualism evolved in almost all replicates, with the remainder growing commensally. Many phage populations also evolved to benefit both their local, evolving bacteria and the ancestral bacteria, though these phages were less beneficial to their co-occurring hosts than phages that harm the ancestral bacteria. These results demonstrate the rapid recovery of mutualism from parasitism, and we discuss how our findings relate to the evolution of phages that enhance the virulence of bacterial pathogens.},

Our results help explain why the United States trails the European Union in publications: The focus in the United States is on industrial funding\textemdash some 70\% of its total R\&D investment. Likewise, our results also help explain why the European Union trails the United States in patenting, since its focus on government funding is less effective than industrial funding in predicting triadic patenting. Government funding contributes negatively to patenting in a multiple regression, and this relationship is significant in the case of triadic patenting. We provide new forecasts about the relationships of the United States, the European Union, and China for publishing; these results suggest much later dates for changes than previous forecasts because Chinese growth has been slowing down since 2003. Models for individual countries might be more successful than regression models whose parameters are averaged over a set of countries because nations can be expected to differ historically in terms of the institutional arrangements and funding schemes.},

Transformation from raw sequencing data to meaningful gene or isoform counts requires an in silico bioinformatics pipeline. Such pipelines are modular in nature, built using selected software and biological references. Software is usually chosen and parameterized according to the sequencing protocol and biological question. However, while biological and technical noise is alleviated through replicates, biases due to the pipeline and choice of biological references are often overlooked. Here, we show that the current standard practice prevents reproducibility in RNA-seq studies by failing to specify required methodological information. Peer-reviewed articles are intended to apply currently accepted scientific and methodological standards. Inasmuch as the bias-less and optimal RNA-seq pipeline is not perfectly defined, methodological information holds a meaningful role in defining the results. This work illustrates the need for a standardized and explicit display of methodological information in RNA-seq experiments.},

Most extant viruses can be characterized as derivatives of ancestors originating from episomal elements of prokaryotes (DNA phages) and later from eukaryotes. Retroviruses very likely originated from cellular retrotransposons. Retrograde evolution of some large viruses from obligatory intracellular bacteria is possible but the ontogenesis of extant bacteria does not include a viral form of existence (the filterable L forms are not viruses) and well-defined viruses do not regenerate back into vegetative bacterial forms. Biologists experimenting with the evolution of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ancient cells cannot ignore the earliest appearance of viruses within or outside the living matter. Viruses participated in and gave direction to the evolution and natural selection by coexisting with uni- and multicellular organisms for billions of years. The coevolution of viruses and their host cells is characterized by incessant attacks and counterattacks through gene rearrangements and mutations (induced in the virus by an immunological counterattack of the host or by transgression of species barriers by the virus) and recombinations. Recombinations occurred between viral and viral or viral and host genes. Acts of "molecular piracy" as practiced by ancient viruses endowed the virus with the expression of several host genes for the advantage of the virus in its replicative cycle and host-to-host spread. Probably the first immortalized and malignantly transformed cells were induced by viruses as viruses evolved anti-apoptotic measures. While infected cells resort to apoptotic death before the assembly of a new viral progeny, prominent are the anti-apoptotic measures viruses evolved in order to assure the completion of their full replicative cycle. Further, viruses may escape neutralization by host antibodies and may survive a counterattack by the host's T cells directed at virally infected cells of its own. Viruses may induce a form of tolerance and coexist with their host without inducing disease. Persistent and apparently or deceivingly apathogenic or even attenuated viral "quasi-species" populations may contain individual particles that regain virulence due to recombinations and/or gene rearrangements, especially when transgressing species barriers. Xenotropic viruses of animals may replicate in human cells and vice versa confounding experiments with xenotransplants or with use of veterinary viral vaccines for the treatment of human diseases.},

Compared to the practical development of the field, the conceptual development is relatively weak. This review article contributes to the latter by elucidating the theoretical aspects of the dominant methods for evaluating societal impact of research, in particular, their presuppositions about the relationship between scientific and societal value of research. We analyse 10 approaches to the assessment of the societal impact of research from a constructivist perspective. The methods represent different understandings of knowledge exchange, which can be understood in terms of linear, cyclical, and co-production models. In addition, the evaluation methods use a variety of concepts for the societal value of research, which suggest different relationships with scientific value. While some methods rely on a clear and explicit distinction between the two types of value, other methods, in particular Evaluative Inquiry, ASIRPA, Contribution Mapping, Public Value Mapping, and SIAMPI, consider the mechanisms for producing societal value integral to the research process. We conclude that evaluation methods must balance between demarcating societal value as a separate performance indicator for practical purposes and doing justice to the (constructivist) science studies' findings about the integration of scientific and societal value of research. Our analytic comparison of assessment methods can assist research evaluators in the conscious and responsible selection of an approach that fits with the object under evaluation. As evaluation actively shapes knowledge production, it is important not to use oversimplified concepts of societal value.},

  abstract = {Archaeal diversity and evolution Archaea are prokaryotes that make up a third branch of the tree of life. Knowledge of archaeal biological diversity and their role in evolution has rapidly expanded in the past decade. Despite the discovery of previously unknown groups and lineages, few lineages have been well studied. Spang et al. review the diversity of Archaea and their genomes, metabolomes, and history, which clarifies the biology and placement of recently discovered archaeal lineages. Science, this issue p. eaaf3883 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDArchaea have been recognized as a major domain of life besides Bacteria and Eukarya for about 40 years. Much of the pioneering research on archaeal organisms was dedicated to studying cellular machineries governing basal cellular processes such as transcription and translation and on elucidating physiological characteristics of the few archaeal strains that could be cultured. Although environmental surveys had started to reveal a plethora of uncultured archaeal lineages during the 1990s, in-depth knowledge about their diversity, ecology, and evolution remained limited. Recent developments in the field of metagenomics and single-cell genomics, however, have allowed the reconstruction of archaeal genomes directly from environmental samples without prior cultivation. Altogether, the use of these cultivation-independent approaches has led to the discovery of a multitude of previously unidentified archaeal lineages, some of which represent completely new branches in the archaeal tree. In this Review, we provide an overview of the currently recognized archaeal diversity, summarize new findings on the metabolic potential of recently described archaeal lineages, and discuss these data in light of archaeal evolution. ADVANCESUp until about a decade ago, all archaea were assigned to one of two major clades: the Crenarchaeota, which mostly comprise extreme thermophiles, or the Euryarchaeota, which mainly included methanogens and halophiles. Since then, our knowledge on archaeal diversity has increased rapidly. Now, Archaea include at least four major supergroups, the Euryarchaeota and the TACK, Asgard, and DPANN archaea, all of which comprise several different, potentially phylum-rank clades (see the figure). The lineages of these groups are not restricted to extreme habitats, as was once thought common for archaeal species; rather, archaea are widespread and occur in all thinkable environments on Earth, where they can make up substantial portions of the microbial biomass.In line with their vast diversity, comparative genomics analyses reveal that Archaea are metabolically versatile and are characterized by different lifestyles. Recently discovered archaeal lineages include mesophiles and (hyper-)thermophiles, anaerobes and aerobes, autotrophs and heterotrophs, a large diversity of putative archaeal symbionts, as well as previously unknown acetogens and different groups of methanogens (see the figure). In fact, both the genetic potential to use the ancient Wood-Ljungdahl carbon fixation pathway and indications for methanogenic traits as well as the ability to anaerobically oxidize methane and other short hydrocarbons have now been found in various lineages outside the Euryarchaeota\textemdash the phylum comprising traditional methanogens and methane oxidizers. So far, little is known about the actual physiology of these archaea in their environmental niches or about their potential syntrophic relationships with other organisms, but recent findings highlight the importance and wide occurrence of these metabolic regimes in a wide diversity of archaea from anaerobic environments. Furthermore, these findings support hypotheses that suggest that all extant archaea evolved from an anaerobic autotrophic ancestor that used the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and may have been able to obtain energy through methanogenesis.Last, the investigation of informational processing and cellular machineries have revealed that genomes of Asgard archaea, which affiliate with eukaryotes in the tree of life (see the figure), encode proteins that they only share with eukaryotes. Excitingly, these proteins are functionally enriched for membrane bending, vesicular biogenesis, and trafficking activities, suggesting that eukaryotes evolved from an archaeal host that contained some key components that governed the emergence of eukaryotic cellular complexity after endosymbiosis. It will be exciting to determine the function of these proteins, which may be involved in species-species interactions in extant members of the Asgard archaea. OUTLOOKThe wealth of novel archaeal genomic data represents a treasure trove for generating testable hypotheses on the metabolic and cellular features of these archaea and will thus help to unveil their thus far poorly characterized biology. Recent findings emphasize the importance of investigating members of the archaeal domain of life in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of microbial ecology, symbiosis, and metabolic interdependencies involving archaeal partners, and of evolution of life on Earth in regard to the deep roots of archaea as well as our microbial ancestry. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/357/6351/eaaf3883/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint The archaeal tree of life.Schematic phylogenetic tree including major archaeal groups for which genomic data are currently available. The currently recognized groups include the Euryarchaeota (green branches) and the TACK, Asgard, and DPANN archaea (tan, yellow, and pink branches, respectively). Eukaryotes (gray branch) are suggested to have emerged from the Asgard archaea upon endosymbiosis with an alphaproteobacterial partner (the mitochondrial endosymbiont). For each archaeal lineage, key characteristics regarding metabolism and lifestyle are depicted. About 40 years ago, Archaea were recognized as a major prokaryotic domain of life besides Bacteria. Recently, cultivation-independent sequencing methods have produced a wealth of genomic data for previously unidentified archaeal lineages, several of which appear to represent newly revealed branches in the tree of life. Analyses of some recently obtained genomes have uncovered previously unknown metabolic traits and provided insights into the evolution of archaea and their relationship to eukaryotes. On the basis of our current understanding, much archaeal diversity still defies genomic exploration. Efforts to obtain and study genomes and enrichment cultures of uncultivated microbial lineages will likely further expand our knowledge about archaeal phylogenetic and metabolic diversity and their cell biology and ecological function.},

LigB differs from LigA in that it lacks the BRCA1 C-terminus domain (BRCT) and two of the four Zn-binding cysteines that are present in LigA and all other bacterial NAD+ ligases. We found that recombinant LigB catalyzed strand joining on a singly-nicked DNA in the presence of a divalent cation and NAD+, and that LigB reacted with NAD+ to form a covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate. Alanine substitution for the motif I lysine (126KxDG) abolished nick joining and ligase-adenylate formation by LigB, thus confirming that the ligase and adenylyltransferase activities are intrinsic to the LigB protein.},

  abstract = {Background Measures to ensure research integrity have been widely discussed due to the social, economic and scientific impact of research integrity. In the past few years, financial support for health research in emerging countries has steadily increased, resulting in a growing number of scientific publications. These achievements, however, have been accompanied by a rise in retracted publications followed by concerns about the quality and reliability of such publications. Objective This systematic review aimed to investigate the profile of medical and life sciences research retractions from authors affiliated with Brazilian academic institutions. The chronological trend between publication and retraction date, reasons for the retraction, citation of the article after the retraction, study design, and the number of retracted publications by author and affiliation were assessed. Additionally, the quality, availability and accessibility of data regarding retracted papers from the publishers are described. Methods Two independent reviewers searched for articles that had been retracted since 2004 via PubMed, Web of Science, Biblioteca Virtual em Sa\'ude (BVS) and Google Scholar databases. Indexed keywords from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Descritores em Ci\^encias da Sa\'ude (DeCS) in Portuguese, English or Spanish were used. Data were also collected from the Retraction Watch website (www.retractionwatch.com). This study was registered with the PROSPERO systematic review database (CRD42017071647). Results A final sample of 65 articles was retrieved from 55 different journals with reported impact factors ranging from 0 to 32.86, with a median value of 4.40 and a mean of 4.69. The types of documents found were erratum (1), retracted articles (3), retracted articles with a retraction notice (5), retraction notices with erratum (3), and retraction notices (45). The assessment of the Retraction Watch website added 8 articles that were not identified by the search strategy using the bibliographic databases. The retracted publications covered a wide range of study designs. Experimental studies (40) and literature reviews (15) accounted for 84.6\% of the retracted articles. Within the field of health and life sciences, medical science was the field with the largest number of retractions (34), followed by biological sciences (17). Some articles were retracted for at least two distinct reasons (13). Among the retrieved articles, plagiarism was the main reason for retraction (60\%). Missing data were found in 57\% of the retraction notices, which was a limitation to this review. In addition, 63\% of the articles were cited after their retraction. Conclusion Publications are not retracted solely for research misconduct but also for honest error. Nevertheless, considering authors affiliated with Brazilian institutions, this review concluded that most of the retracted health and life sciences publications were retracted due to research misconduct. Because the number of publications is the most valued indicator of scientific productivity for funding and career progression purposes, a systematic effort from the national research councils, funding agencies, universities and scientific journals is needed to avoid an escalating trend of research misconduct. More investigations are needed to comprehend the underlying factors of research misconduct and its increasing manifestation.},

Efforts to tackle our most pressing issues have been stymied by conflict within the scientific community and mixed messages symptomatic of a rushed approach. What is more, scientific research is being shaped by the bubbles and crashes associated with economic speculation and the market. A focus on conformism, competitiveness, opportunism and flexibility has made it extremely difficult to present cases of failure to the public, for fear that it will lose confidence in science altogether. In this bold new book, distinguished philosopher Isabelle Stengers shows that research is deeply intertwined with broader social interests, which means that science cannot race ahead in isolation but must learn instead to slow down. Stengers offers a path to an alternative science, arguing that researchers should stop seeing themselves as the 'thinking, rational brain of humanity' and refuse to allow their expertise to be used to shut down the concerns of the public, or to spread the belief that scientific progress is inevitable and will resolve all of society's problems. Rather, science must engage openly and honestly with an intelligent public and be clear about the kind of knowledge it is capable of producing. This timely and accessible book will be of great interest to students, scholars and policymakers in a wide range of fields, as well anyone concerned with the role of science and its future.},

To chart a new future for open publishing, we must consider alternatives to the core features of the legacy print publishing system, such as an access paywall and editorial selection before publication. Although journals have their strengths, the traditional approach of selecting articles before publication (``curate first, publish second'') forces a focus on ``getting into the right journals,'' which can delay dissemination of scientific work, create opportunity costs for pushing science forward, and promote undesirable behaviors among scientists and the institutions that evaluate them. We believe that a ``publish first, curate second'' approach with the following features would be a strong alternative: authors decide when and what to publish; peer review reports are published, either anonymously or with attribution; and curation occurs after publication, incorporating community feedback and expert judgment to select articles for target audiences and to evaluate whether scientific work has stood the test of time. These proposed changes could optimize publishing practices for the digital age, emphasizing transparency, peer-mediated improvement, and post-publication appraisal of scientific articles.},

For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (               i               ) requesting data and code from authors and (               ii               ) attempting replication of the published findings.

The extent of collaboration cannot be easily determined by traditional methods of survey and observation. Bibliometric methods offer a convenient and non-reactive tool for studying collaboration in research.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolution of DNA polymerases, the key enzymes of DNA replication and repair, is central to any reconstruction of the history of cellular life. However, the details of the evolutionary relationships between DNA polymerases of archaea and eukaryotes remain unresolved. RESULTS: We performed a comparative analysis of archaeal, eukaryotic, and bacterial B-family DNA polymerases, which are the main replicative polymerases in archaea and eukaryotes, combined with an analysis of domain architectures. Surprisingly, we found that eukaryotic Polymerase epsilon consists of two tandem exonuclease-polymerase modules, the active N-terminal module and a C-terminal module in which both enzymatic domains are inactivated. The two modules are only distantly related to each other, an observation that suggests the possibility that Pol epsilon evolved as a result of insertion and subsequent inactivation of a distinct polymerase, possibly, of bacterial descent, upstream of the C-terminal Zn-fingers, rather than by tandem duplication. The presence of an inactivated exonuclease-polymerase module in Pol epsilon parallels a similar inactivation of both enzymatic domains in a distinct family of archaeal B-family polymerases. The results of phylogenetic analysis indicate that eukaryotic B-family polymerases, most likely, originate from two distantly related archaeal B-family polymerases, one form giving rise to Pol epsilon, and the other one to the common ancestor of Pol alpha, Pol delta, and Pol zeta. The C-terminal Zn-fingers that are present in all eukaryotic B-family polymerases, unexpectedly, are homologous to the Zn-finger of archaeal D-family DNA polymerases that are otherwise unrelated to the B family. The Zn-finger of Polepsilon shows a markedly greater similarity to the counterpart in archaeal PolD than the Zn-fingers of other eukaryotic B-family polymerases. CONCLUSION: Evolution of eukaryotic DNA polymerases seems to have involved previously unnoticed complex events. We hypothesize that the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes encoded three DNA polymerases, namely, two distinct B-family polymerases and a D-family polymerase all of which contributed to the evolution of the eukaryotic replication machinery. The Zn-finger might have been acquired from PolD by the B-family form that gave rise to Pol epsilon prior to or in the course of eukaryogenesis, and subsequently, was captured by the ancestor of the other B-family eukaryotic polymerases. The inactivated polymerase-exonuclease module of Pol epsilon might have evolved by fusion with a distinct polymerase, rather than by duplication of the active module of Pol epsilon, and is likely to play an important role in the assembly of eukaryotic replication and repair complexes.},

In the third domain of life, the archaea, multiple types of ssDNA-binding protein are found with a variety of domain architectures and subunit compositions, with OB-fold ssDNA-binding domains being a characteristic of most, but not all. This chapter summarizes current knowledge of the distribution, structure, and biological function of the archaeal ssDNA-binding factors, highlighting key features shared between clades and those that distinguish the proteins of different clades from one another.

  abstract = {The halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii degrades glucose via the semiphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway and can also grow on gluconeogenic substrates. Here, the enzymes catalysing the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to 3-phosphoglycerate were analysed. The genome contains the genes gapI and gapII encoding two putative GAP dehydrogenases, and pgk encoding phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). We show that gapI is functionally involved in sugar catabolism, whereas gapII is involved in gluconeogenesis. For pgk, an amphibolic function is indicated. This is the first report of the functional involvement of a phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and PGK in sugar catabolism in archaea. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the catabolic gapI from H. volcanii is acquired from bacteria via lateral genetransfer, whereas the anabolic gapII as well as pgk are of archaeal origin.},

Hated or loved, the JIF dominated academic publishing for the better part of six decades. However, a rise in the ranks of unscholarly journals, academic corruption and fraud has also seen the accompaniment of a parallel universe of competing metrics, some of which might also be predatory, misleading, or fraudulent, while others yet may in fact be valid. On December 8, 2016, Elsevier B.V. launched a direct competing metric to the JIF, CiteScore (CS). This short communication explores the similarities and differences between JIF and CS. It also explores what this seismic shift in metrics culture might imply for journal readership and authorship.},

  abstract = {Scholarly communication is in a perpetual state of disruption. Within this, peer review of research articles remains an essential part of the formal publication process, distinguishing it from virtually all other modes of communication. In the last several years, there has been an explosive wave of innovation in peer review research, platforms, discussions, tools and services. This is largely coupled with the ongoing and parallel evolution of scholarly communication as it adapts to rapidly changing environments, within what is widely considered as the 'open research' or 'open science' movement. Here, we summarise the current ebb and flow around changes to peer review and consider its role in a modern digital research and communications infrastructure and suggest why uptake of new models of peer review appears to have been so low compared to what is often viewed as the 'traditional' method of peer review. Finally, we offer some insight into the potential futures of scholarly peer review and consider what impacts this might have on the broader scholarly research ecosystem. In particular, we focus on the key traits of certification and reputation, moderation and quality control and engagement incentives, and discuss how these interact with socio-technical aspects of peer review and academic culture.},

Despite its critical importance, it curiously remains poorly understood in a number of dimensions. In order to address this, we have analysed peer review to assess where the major gaps in our theoretical and empirical understanding of it lie. We identify core themes including editorial responsibility, the subjectivity and bias of reviewers, the function and quality of peer review, and the social and epistemic implications of peer review. The high-priority gaps are focused around increased accountability and justification in decision-making processes for editors and developing a deeper, empirical understanding of the social impact of peer review. Addressing this at the bare minimum will require the design of a consensus for a minimal set of standards for what constitutes peer review, and the development of a shared data infrastructure to support this. Such a field requires sustained funding and commitment from publishers and research funders, who both have a commitment to uphold the integrity of the published scholarly record. We use this to present a guide for the future of peer review, and the development of a new research discipline based on the study of peer review.},

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

  abstract = {The discipline of bibliometrics involves the application of mathematical and statistical methods to scholarly publications. The first attempts at systematic data collection were provided by Alfred Lotka and Samuel Bradford, who subsequently established the foundational laws of bibliometrics. Eugene Garfield ushered in the modern era of bibliometrics with the routine use of citation analysis and systematized processing. Key elements of bibliometric analysis include database coverage, consistency and accuracy of the data, data fields, search options, and analysis and use of metrics. A number of bibliometric applications are currently being used in medical science and health care. Bibliometric parameters and indexes may be increasingly used by grant funding sources as measures of research success. Universities may build benchmarking standards from bibliometric data to determine academic achievement through promotion and tenure guidelines in the future. This article reviews the history, definition, laws, and elements of bibliometric principles and provides examples of bibliometric applications to the broader health care community. To accomplish this, the Medline (1966\textendash 2014) and Web of Science (1945\textendash 2014) databases were searched to identify relevant articles; select articles were also cross-referenced. Articles selected were those that provided background, history, descriptive analysis, and application of bibliometric principles and metrics to medical science and health care. No attempt was made to cover all areas exhaustively; rather, key articles were chosen that illustrate bibliometric concepts and enhance the reader's knowledge. It is important that faculty and researchers understand the limitations and appropriate uses of bibliometric data. Bibliometrics has considerable potential as a research area for health care scientists and practitioners that can be used to discover new information about academic trends, pharmacotherapy, disease, and broader health sciences trends.},

Classified into C-family of DNA polymerases they come in two major forms, PolC and DnaE, related by ancient duplication. While PolC represents an evolutionary compact group, DnaE can be further subdivided into at least three groups (DnaE13). We performed an extensive analysis of various sequence, structure and surface properties of all four polymerase groups. Our analysis suggests a specific evolutionary pathway leading to PolC and DnaE from the last common ancestor and reveals important differences between extant polymerase groups. Among them, DnaE1 and PolC show the highest conservation of the analyzed properties. DnaE3 polymerases apparently represent an `impaired' version of DnaE1. Nonessential DnaE2 polymerases, typical for oxygen-using bacteria with large GC-rich genomes, have a number of features in common with DnaE3 polymerases. The analysis of polymerase distribution in genomes revealed three major combinations: DnaE1 either alone or accompanied by one or more DnaE2s, PolC+DnaE3 and PolC+DnaE1. The first two combinations are present in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. The third one (PolC+DnaE1), found in Clostridia, represents a novel, so far experimentally uncharacterized, set.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Bibliometrics is a science which evaluates the impact of the scientific work of a journal or of an author, using mathematical and statistical tools. Impact Factor (IF) is the first bibliometric parameter created, and after it many others have been progressively conceived in order to go beyond its limits. Currently bibliometric indexes are used for academic purposes, among them to evaluate the eligibility of a researcher to compete for the National Scientific Qualification, in order to access to competitive exams to become professor. Objective. Aim of this study is to identify the most relevant bibliometric indexes and to summarized their characteristics. Methods. A revision of bibliometric indexes as been conducted, starting from the classic ones and completing with the most recent ones. Results. The two most used bibliometric indexes are the IF, which measures the scientific impact of a periodical and bases on Web of Science citation database, and the h-index, which measures the impact of the scientific work of a researcher, basing on Scopus database. Besides them other indexes have been created more recently, such as the SCImago Journal Rank Indicator (SJR), the Source Normalised Impact per Paper (SNIP) and the CiteScore index. They are all based on Scopus database and evaluate, in different ways, the citational impact of a periodic. The i10-index instead is provided from Google Scholar database and allows to evaluate the impact of the scientific production of a researcher. Recently two softwares have been introduced: the first one, Publish or Perish, allows to evaluate the scientific work of a researcher, through the assessment of many indexes; the second one, Altmetric, measure the use in the Web of the academic papers, instead of measuring citations, by means of alternative metrics respect to the traditional ones. Conclusions. Each analized index shows advantages but also criticalities. Therefore the combined use of more than one indexes, citational and not, should be preferred, in order to correctly evaluate the work of reserchers and to finally improve the quality and the development of scientific research.

After reviewing the rationale of bibliometric analysis, we present the basic principle of the bibliometric methodology, with complex citation networks as a starting point. We show that the two main pillars of advanced bibliometric methods, citation-based analysis and science mapping, are both reducible to one and the same principle. From this basic principle we deduce a set of main indicators, particularly for the assessment of research output and international impact. Important elements include new approaches for identifying fields and research themes on the basis of a publication-level rather than a journal-level network; publication and citation counting; normalization of citation measures; the use of indicators based on averages versus those based on citation distributions; and weighting procedures and statistical reliability. In this account of the state of the art of advanced bibliometrics , we highlight in particular the developments in our Leiden institute, given its long-standing, extensive, and broad experience.The next part of this chapter deals with practical applications of indicators, particularly real-life examples of evaluation studies. We further discuss several crucial issues such as the use of journal impact factors and h-index; the relation between peer review judgment and bibliometric findings; definition and delimitation of fields; assignment of publications; the influence of open access; webometrics and altmetrics; ranking of universities; and general objections to bibliometric analysis.The second main pillar of the advanced bibliometric methodology is the development of science maps. We discuss the basic elements and the construction of both citation-relation and word-relation science maps. Further, we present a method to combine the two main pillars: the integration of citation analysis in science maps. This combined citation analysis and science mapping can be used to explore research related to socioeconomic problems. Recently developed bibliometric instruments enable tunable mapping, which opens up new analytical opportunities in monitoring scientific research. Finally, we contend that bibliometric indicators and maps are not just evaluation tools for science policymakers, research managers, and individual researchers, but also powerful instruments in the study of science.},

Whereas the central metabolic routes of bacteria and eukaryotes are generally well-conserved, variant pathways have developed in Archaea involving several novel enzymes with a distinct control. A spectacular example of convergent evolution concerns the glucose-degrading pathways of saccharolytic archaea. The identification, characterization and comparison of the glycolytic enzymes of a variety of phylogenetic lineages have revealed a mosaic of canonical and novel enzymes in the archaeal variants of the Embden-Meyerhof and the Entner-Doudoroff pathways. By means of integrating results from biochemical and genetic studies with recently obtained comparative and functional genomics data, the structure and function of the archaeal glycolytic routes, the participating enzymes and their regulation are re-evaluated.},

  abstract = {Archaea were initially thought to be confined to extreme environments, but they are now known to occur ubiquitously in nature and to be important players in global biogeochemical cycles. Archaea are characterized by their unique membrane lipids, which contain isoprene units that are linked to the glycerol backbone by ether bonds (archaeol; C20) in a bilayer and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT; C40) in a monolayer.Comparison of the phylogenetic composition of Archaea with the distribution of membrane ether lipids shows that most lipids are not specific for a certain phylogenetic group. Only the GDGT crenarchaeol, which contains four cyclopentane moieties and a cyclohexane moiety, is considered to be characteristic of the Thaumarchaeota, which suggests that the biosynthesis of the cyclohexane moiety is unique to this phylum.The current conception of the archaeal membrane ether lipid biosynthetic pathway involves the condensation of units of isopentenyl diphosphate to form geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP; C20) by a GGPP synthase. The formation of the two ether bonds is catalysed by the geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate (GGGP) synthase and the digeranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate (DGGGP) synthase. The formation of GDGTs is thought to involve a head-to-head coupling between the two archaeol lipids, followed by internal cyclization to form cyclopentane moieties. These reactions are highly unusual and the enzymes that are involved are unknown.The analysis of the amino acid sequence of most of the archaeal GGGP synthases suggests that they could accommodate substrates {$>$}C20 that already have rings present.The synthesis of the unique cyclohexane moiety-containing GDGT crenarchaeol by Thaumarchaeota might explain the inability to annotate DGGGP synthases in thaumarchaeotal genomes, as a currently unknown, highly divergent DGGGP synthase would be required to accommodate the isoprenyl chain containing the 'bulky' cyclohexane moiety.An alternative archaeal lipid biosynthetic pathway pathway is presented, which is based on a 'multiple-key, multiple-lock' mechanism for which multiple keys with different configurations (owing to the presence of rings) would need to accommodate and specifically interact at the molecular level with different locks (isoprenylglyceryl phosphate synthase and di-isoprenylglyceryl phosphate synthase). This pathway is consistent with most of the phylogenetic relationships that were observed in our study as well as with most of the experimental evidence for the different GDGT biosynthetic steps, and it is supported by possible intermediates that have previously been described.},

  abstract = {The lipid membrane is one of the most characteristic traits distinguishing the three domains of life. Membrane lipids of Bacteria and Eukarya are composed of fatty acids linked to glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) via ester bonds, while those of Archaea possess isoprene-based alkyl chains linked by ether linkages to glycerol-1-phosphate (G1P), resulting in the opposite stereochemistry of the glycerol phosphate backbone. This `lipid divide' has raised questions on the evolution of microbial life since eukaryotes are thought to have evolved from the Archaea, requiring a radical change in membrane composition. Here, we searched for homologs of enzymes involved in membrane lipid and fatty acid synthesis in a wide variety of archaeal genomes and performed phylogenomic analyses. We found that two uncultured archaeal groups, i.e. marine euryarchaeota group II/III and `Lokiarchaeota', recently discovered descendants of the archaeal ancestor leading to eukaryotes, lack the gene to synthesize G1P and, consequently, the capacity to synthesize archaeal membrane lipids. However, our analyses reveal their genetic capacity to synthesize G3P-based `chimeric lipids' with either two ether-bound isoprenoidal chains or with an ester-bound fatty acid instead of an ether-bound isoprenoid. These archaea may reflect the `archaea-to-eukaryote' membrane transition stage which have led to the current `lipid divide'.},

Assessing the validity of a contribution via replicability of its experimental evidence and reproducibility of its analyses requires access to relevant study materials, data, and code. Failing to share them limits the ability to scrutinize or build-upon the research, ultimately hindering scientific progress.Understanding how the diverse research artifacts in HCI impact sharing can help produce informed recommendations for individual researchers and policy-makers in HCI. Therefore, we surveyed authors of CHI 2018-2019 papers, asking if they share their papers' research materials and data, how they share them, and why they do not. The results (34\% response rate) show that sharing is uncommon, partly due to misunderstandings about the purpose of sharing and reliable hosting. We conclude with recommendations for fostering open research practices.This paper and all data and materials are freely available at https://osf.io/3bu6t.},

Next, selected topics in the literature on citation impact indicators are reviewed in detail. The first topic is the selection of publications and citations to be included in the calculation of citation impact indicators. The second topic is the normalization of citation impact indicators, in particular normalization for field differences. Counting methods for dealing with co-authored publications are the third topic, and citation impact indicators for journals are the last topic. The paper concludes by offering some recommendations for future research.},

In order to eliminate the possible redundancy in feature space, three feature selection techniques of Relief-F, principal component analysis and entropy weighted method were used to rank the features according to their contribution to the original data set. Combining the fractal dimension of the data set, the intrinsic features which can better represent the original feature space were extracted. Three classifiers of Na\"ive Bayes, KNN and random forest were performed to detect the classification performance of these features. Experimental results show that both bibliometric indices and alternative metrics are beneficial to articles' growth. Early citation features, early Web usage statistics, as well as the reputation of the first author are the most valuable indicators in making an article more influential in the future.},

One similarity, though, is that much discussion of their ecological strategies has invoked concepts such as oligotrophy or stress tolerance. For plants, so-called `trait ecology'\textemdash strategy description reframed along measurable trait dimensions\textemdash has made global syntheses possible. Among widely measured trait dimensions for bacteria and archaea three main axes are evident. Maximum growth rate in association with rRNA operon copy number expresses a rate-yield trade-off that is analogous to the acquisitive\textendash conservative spectrum in plants, though underpinned by different trade-offs. Genome size in association with signal transduction expresses versatility. Cell size has influence on diffusive uptake and on relative wall costs. These trait dimensions, and potentially others, offer promise for interpreting ecology. At the same time, there are very substantial differences from plant trait ecology. Traits and their underpinning trade-offs are different. Also, bacteria and archaea use a variety of different substrates. Bacterial strategies can be viewed both through the facet of substrate-use pathways, and also through the facet of quantitative traits such as maximum growth rate. Preliminary evidence shows the quantitative traits vary widely within substrate-use pathways. This indicates they convey information complementary to substrate use.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent controversies highlighting substandard peer review in Open Access (OA) and traditional (subscription) journals have increased the need for authors, funders, publishers, and institutions to assure quality of peer-review in academic journals. I propose that transparency of the peer-review process may be seen as an indicator of the quality of peer-review, and develop and validate a tool enabling different stakeholders to assess transparency of the peer-review process. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Based on editorial guidelines and best practices, I developed a 14-item tool to rate transparency of the peer-review process on the basis of journals' websites. In Study 1, a random sample of 231 authors of papers in 92 subscription journals in different fields rated transparency of the journals that published their work. Authors' ratings of the transparency were positively associated with quality of the peer-review process but unrelated to journal's impact factors. In Study 2, 20 experts on OA publishing assessed the transparency of established (non-OA) journals, OA journals categorized as being published by potential predatory publishers, and journals from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Results show high reliability across items ({$\alpha$} = .91) and sufficient reliability across raters. Ratings differentiated the three types of journals well. In Study 3, academic librarians rated a random sample of 140 DOAJ journals and another 54 journals that had received a hoax paper written by Bohannon to test peer-review quality. Journals with higher transparency ratings were less likely to accept the flawed paper and showed higher impact as measured by the h5 index from Google Scholar. CONCLUSIONS: The tool to assess transparency of the peer-review process at academic journals shows promising reliability and validity. The transparency of the peer-review process can be seen as an indicator of peer-review quality allowing the tool to be used to predict academic quality in new journals.},

  abstract = {DNA ligases join breaks in the phosphodiester backbone of DNA molecules and are used in many essential reactions within the cell. All DNA ligases follow the same reaction mechanism, but they may use either ATP or NAD+ as a cofactor. All Bacteria (eubacteria) contain NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, and the uniqueness of these enzymes to Bacteria makes them an attractive target for novel antibiotics. In addition to their NAD+-dependent enzymes, some Bacteria contain genes for putative ATP-dependent DNA ligases. The requirement for these different isozymes in Bacteria is unknown, but may be related to their utilization in different aspects of DNA metabolism. The putative ATP-dependent DNA ligases found in Bacteria are most closely related to proteins from Archaea and viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that all NAD+-dependent DNA ligases are closely related, but the ATP-dependent enzymes have been acquired by Bacterial genomes on a number of separate occasions.},

  abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

Some highly conserved regions were identified in the mitochondrial 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes of these species. To test whether these sequences are universally conserved, primers were designed to target the conserved regions of these two genes and were used to amplify DNA from 21 animal tissues, including two of unknown origin. By sequencing these PCR amplicons and aligning the sequences to a database of non-redundant nucleotide sequences, it was confirmed that these amplicons aligned specifically to mtDNA sequences from the expected species of origin. This molecular technique, when combined with bioinformatics, provides a reliable method for the taxonomic classification of animal tissues.},

Structural studies reveal clamp loaders to be heteropentamers. Each subunit contains a region of homology to AAA+ proteins that defines two domains. The AAA+ domains form a right-handed spiral upon binding ATP. This spiral arrangement generates a DNA binding site within the center of RFC. DNA enters the central chamber through a gap between the AAA+ domains of two subunits. Specificity for a primed template junction is achieved by a third domain that blocks DNA, forcing it to bend sharply. Thus only DNA with a flexible joint can bind the central chamber. DNA entry also requires a slot in the PCNA clamp, which is opened upon binding the AAA+ domains of the clamp loader. ATP hydrolysis enables clamp closing and ejection of RFC, completing the clamp loading reaction.},

Data were used to explore relevant aspects related to the scientific production in OER, such as: (i) number of publications per year; (ii) most cited publications; (iii) authors with higher number of publications; (iv) institutions and countries with more publications and (v) most referenced bibliography by the authors. The analysis has included 544 papers, written by 843 authors, from 338 institutions, from 61 different countries. Moreover, the analysis has included the publications referenced and the author's keywords, considering 6,355 different publications and 929 different keywords. Besides presenting a bibliographic mapping of the research on OER, this paper also intends to contribute to consolidate the idea that OER is a promising field for researchers, in line with the spreading of the Open movement.},

We review how this approach has highlighted the importance of recombination as an evolutionary parameter and provided insight into a molecular mechanism of recombination that may be unique in the archaeal domain. We review the development and improvement of the model system S. islandicus that will enable us to study the mechanism and genomic architecture of recombination guided by evolutionary genomic analysis of Nature's ongoing experiments in wild populations.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models are key to systems biology where they typically describe the topology and dynamics of biological networks, listing biochemical entities and their relationships with one another. Some (hyper)thermophilic Archaea contain an enzyme, called non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN), which catalyzes the direct oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate omitting adenosine 5{${'}$}-triphosphate (ATP) formation by substrate-level-phosphorylation via phosphoglycerate kinase. In this study we formulate three hypotheses that could explain functionally why GAPN exists in these Archaea, and then construct and use mathematical models to test these three hypotheses. We used kinetic parameters of enzymes of Sulfolobus solfataricus (S. solfataricus) which is a thermo-acidophilic archaeon that grows optimally between 60 and 90 \textdegree C and between pH 2 and 4. For comparison, we used a model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), an organism that can live at moderate temperatures. We find that both the first hypothesis, i.e., that the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plus phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) route (the alternative to GAPN) is thermodynamically too much uphill and the third hypothesis, i.e., that GAPDH plus PGK are required to carry the flux in the gluconeogenic direction, are correct. The second hypothesis, i.e., that the GAPDH plus PGK route delivers less than the 1 ATP per pyruvate that is delivered by the GAPN route, is only correct when GAPDH reaction has a high rate and 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate (BPG) spontaneously degrades to 3PG at a high rate.},

We use the data of 37 Chinese economics journals from 2001 to 2019 and apply synthetic control method to causally estimate the effects of open data, and our results show that open data has significantly increased the citations of journal articles. On average, the current- and second-year citations of articles published with CIE have increased by 1\,\textasciitilde\,4 times, and articles published before the open data policy also benefited from the spillover effect.
